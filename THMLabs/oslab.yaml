#Operating System Security.
#This is an overview of the OS security module in Try Hack Me
#This is an extension of OS security class that I took in my info_sec 563 class
#This ensures a more detail hands-on experience and more modern trends and events in regards to OS security.
OS is the layer that is between hardware (keyboard, mouse, monitor etc) and applications and programs (Web broswer(Firefox, Chrome, Messaging app (Whatsapp,
Telegram)). OS are of different types and functions that includes-
- OS for Phones - iOS for iphones, Android for Samsung, Huawei, etc
- OS for laptops/personal computers/monitors - MS Windows, MacOS, Linux etc.
- OS for Servers - MS Windows Server 2022, IBM AIX, Oracle Solaris etc.
Android (Most smartphones run this) is the OS currently controlling the market share among all OS's. It has market share of about 39.4% according to Statcounter 2022
Followed by Windows, with 32.1% (most PCs run on this).
Followed by iOS (iphones run on this), with 17.6%
Others make the rest of the percentage to round it up to 100%.
PCs and Phones could contain data that need to be protected. These data includes:
- Private conversations - texts, chats, messaging apps convo etc
- Private photos
- Emails from gmail, yahoo, outlook etc
- Saved passwords
- Apps
- Personal files, documents etc- copies of birth certificate, SSN, passport etc
The data we are always trying to protect to ensure the security of all these items will follow CIA
Confidentiality- For example, all data that I have on my PC or Phone should only be able to be viewed by me, because the PC or phone is meant
for me and intended for me. So with my pin or password, i can access any of these devices and perform any action. However, I could allow
some other users access by giving them my password or pin
Integrity- What data ( e.g file scans) etc. that i do on my PC must not be allowed to be tampered with by unauthorized user. Because gmail uses
https and other security proof features, when i send a copy of my documents to someone else, it should only be accessible by the intended person.
Nobody else should have access to it in transit or at rest.
Availability- My devices should always be available to me whenever I want to use it. No other person should have control over them.

#OS Vulnerabilities or weaknesses that attackers could exploit include
1) Authentication and weak passwords- If the authentication on a server is not full security proof, an attacker could exploit it. If the server
does not have a MFA, or proxy or joined AD with defined role to access it, an attacker could use brute force or other means to gain access.
Setting up authentication through SSO, AD, etc. M
Maintaining MFA
Practicing least privilege access policy
Not saving credentials or passwords in plain sight
Implementing multi character strong password through Secret manager, passwordstate etc
Using keys
Setting up proxy servers etc.
Using complex passwords and different passwords for different accounts
2) Weak file permissions- When every Tom, Dick and Harry have access to all files, spurs enormous risks and threats. 
Defining access based on roles
Putting a policy in place to dictate how access will be assigned
Practicing least privilege access policy
No to indiscriminate access to root files
3) Malicious programs- Sophisticated attacks created by attackers that target systems e.g Trojan Horse, Ransomware (encrypt your files so
control the availability from CIA and requests for ransom to get back the availability)

#Lab
- Tricking target to run a malicious file
- Obtaining credentials (username and password)

#Obtaining credentials (username and password)
Because most servers use root or administrator as usernames, an attacker could try to guess the password and use brute force, then escalate
privileges to a SA.

- Went to a client's company
- Got a sticky note with a names Sammie and dragon
- Guessed the username for access to a server could be sammie and password dragon
- Started a terminal on a Linux server
- Ran ssh command to access the machine - "ssh sammie@MACHINE_IP"
- With the warning message, click on yes to Continue
- Enter password with the guessed one - "dragon"
- Run a "whoami" command to validate that the user with the access it sammie
- If successful, run "ls" to view the files that in the current directory (pwd)
- To see some details about contents of a particular file, run "cat $filename"
- Run "history" to view set of commands that have beens used by users and some usernames.
- Assuming that they are not following security best practices now, use one of the username and guess some common password from the darkweb list
- Exit from sammie
- Run "ssh johnny@$MACHINE_IP"
- Guess the passwords
- Password that got successful was "abc123" for Johnny
- Run "history" again. You could be lucky to see a password among the list.
- Switch to root account from johnny- run "su - root"
- Enter the password that was seen in history as root password
- Run "ls"
- Obtain the content of the file - "flag.txt"
