#Web Application Security
Web apps are applications you don't need to install on your laptops or mobile phones to be able to access them. Once you have a browser,
you should be able to access a web app. Some of the common web apps that you can access are
- online shopping apps e.g Amazon, Macy's, Etsy, Ebay, Walmart etc
- online banking apps e.g Wells Fargo, BOA etc
- Webmails- Gmail, Outlook, Yahoomail etc
- Online office suites e.g Words, Powerpoint, Excel, Docs, Sheet etc
- Money transfer e.g Western Union, Money Gram, Worldremit etc
- Social media e.g LinkedIn, Facebook etc.

To be able to access all these web apps, you need a web browser. All the web apps can be accessed through a web browser e.g Chrome, Firefox
Safari, etc.

There is a need for security of web application, from the top of my head, I will say an organization or company with web apps, always put
these set of security measures in place. If they have not, they should try to implement them.
1) MFA
2) SSL
3) HTTPS
4) Decoupled/ Asynchronous web application- The major components of the web app are all decoupled- Product should be independent of
Sales, Sales should be independent of Search, Checkout should be independent of Shipping etc.
5) Architecture/ App Stack should be decoupled too- Web tier should be sepearte from App tier and Database
6) Follow up to number 5 is that no direct access from a user's request to the database.
7) Ensure segmentation and firewalls implementations in your web app.
8) Strong password implementations for users'- multi characters and long . I guess 15 characters at least


####
Some Web App Attacks/Vulnerabilities/Weakness
Some loopholes or weaknesses that an attacker could exploit in a web app include
1) Identification and Authentication Attack - Ordinarily, for a user to successfully access a web app, a user needs to be identified and
then authenticated through credentials that are provided. These credentails can be exploited by an attacker through
- Brute force - random guessing of passwords through script or automation tools . If mandatory multi character password implementation is
integrated for the web app, it may forestall this.
- Weak password - Guessing of passwords through combination of users' names or date of birth could. Implementing at least 15 multi characters 
password could help
- Passwords in plaintext- I doubt if any web app are still run with passwords in plaintext. But if there is any that still does this, it will be
easier for an attacker to exploit this.
- Logging page allwoing for unlimited attempts to login. I think it is 3 times at most these days

2) Access Control Attack-
If the access control policy in an organization is weak or broken or non strictly implemeted, a web app would be prone to easy attacks.
Inability to implement assigning least privilege permissions to users in a company or implementing a role-based access could cause access
control related attacks. i.e if an employee in support is having save privileges as an employee in security or finance etc
Some access control related threats or vulnerabilities include
- Mistakenly allowing a write access/privilege to a user or customer . A concrete access control policy that defines principles of least
privilege to both employees and users vis-a-vis privilege they can have will prevent this.
- Exploitation of UI - PCI DSS compliance and other compliance to regulations will prevent this.
- Insecure Direct Object References Vulnerability (IDOR)

3) Injection Attack
- Proper handling of data according to laid down rules and regulations. Adhering to CIA and other security and access control policies
will prevent this too. Regular patching, Cert renewal, encryption and others could prevent this kind of attack too.

4) Cryptographic related attacks
Attacks related to encryption and decryption.
- Not implementing the use of HTTPS
- Usage of default keys etc
- Having credentials in plaintext.

#IDOR Lab
An attacker exploiting a broken access control in a system by having access to info or carrying out functions that they are not authorized 
to do.
- A user having access to an image and manipulating the characters or parameters that make up the image to perform an unthorized action
- Ability for a user to be able to manipulate/ exploit a url
- Attackers can exploit IDOR on a manufacturing coy to stall production and collect ransom to stem their control.

#Example
An attacker exploited the url of a production company by successfully manipulating a number in the url that references the inventory
management system of the company
- To fix or stall this, you need to fix the url to ensure that no matter the random number that an attacker may use to exploit the system
there will be no access since he/she is not authorized to be able to modify anything in the system. 
- Also need to fix the inventory management system to be able to performing its fucntions as it were before the attack
- Contain the attack
- Eradicate the attack
- Recover the system
- Ensure there is no IDOR related vulnerabilities in url or in the system moving forward.

####Security Operations Center
Monitor network and systems of a company 24 hours in a day and 7 days in a week.
Responsibilities may include but not limited to
- Finding vulnerabilities: Looking for vulnerabilities and taking actions like recommended patching or whatever that is recommended
- Detect authorized activity: Detecting credentials of a user was used without authorization. Change in geographic location could a pointer.
- Discover policy violation: e.g not sharing of files through ftp may trigger this
- Detect intrusions: Intrusion through a user inadvertently clicking a malicious link.
- Support with incident response: In the event of any incident, get into action to resolve this.

SOC Data Sources include:
- Server Logs: Logs from servers like mail server, web server, dc on ms windows network etc. Getting info like successful and blocked login attempts
- DNS activity: Finding info about domain names that are interacting with your orgs DNS server (e.golajide.com). The IPs. Run a DNS query to get
this and notice a DNS query repeating every minute- behavior is not that of a user browsing the internet. A laptopcan be communicating with
a malicious server. Detect the laptop, Isolate the laptop, clean it up of the malware and begin threat hunting on other laptops in the network to validate
that they are not infected.
- Firewall Logs: Knowing the packets that are allowed into or blocked from your network. Dealing with source and destination IPs. 
Source and destination ports.
- DHCP Logs: Knowing IPs that are assigned to systems. Knowing the devices that have joined your orgs network. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- Database Logs: Logs from the databases. Who has logged in or not.

SOC Services: Both reactive and proactive services.
Reactive services include:
1. Monitor security posture - Monitor network and computers for security notifications and incidents and responding to them
2. Vulnerability management - Finding vulnerabilites in the system and patching them.
3. Malware analysis - Recover malware that reached the system. Carry out basic analysis in a controlled environment before escalating.
4. Intrusion detection - Monitor with your IDS tool and take action.
5. Reporting - Report your findings to stakeholders and for compliance sake.
Proactive services include:
1. Network security monitoring (NSM) - Monitoring the network data and analysing it to find if there is an intrusion.
2. Threat hunting - assumes intrusion has taken place and then trying to investigate if the assumption was true.
3. Threat intelligence - Learning about potential adversaries and their techniques and tactics to improve the orgs's defense

Lab using firewall rule to BLOCK a suspicious IP

Source IP Address   Destination IP Address    Source Port   Destination Port    Action
172.16.4.1            10.10.10.41               ANY            80                PASS
172.16.8.1            10.10.10.81               ANY            23                DROP

This is saying all packets from the source IP "172.16.4.1 " to the destination IP "10.10.10.41" to the destination PORT NUMBER "80" should
be "ALLOWED". All packets from the source IP "172.16.8.1 " to the destination IP "10.10.10.80" to the destination PORT NUMBER "23" should
be "BLOCKED" because of malicious activities

####Lab using a firewall rule to BLOCK a MALICIOUS IP
###Discover that website 203.0.110.1 is being attacked and you want to create a firewall rule to block it.
- Discover that the source IP of the attack is 198.51.100.34 and destination port number for access into your website is 80.
- The source IP to be allowed is 203.0.113.19
- You are only concerned about BLOCKING the malicious IP
- Do this
Source IP Address   Destination IP Address   Destination Port    Action
198.51.100.34         203.0.110.1               80                DROP
