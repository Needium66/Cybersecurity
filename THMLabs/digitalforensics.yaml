#Digital Forensics THM
#Steps to follow to investigate as an investigator in a crime scene
1. Acquire the evidence: Collect the digital devices e.g laptops, storage devices, usb etc.
2. Establish a chain of custody: Authorized investigator will fill out a form
3. Place evidence in a secure container: Evidences collected in step 1 will be placed in a secure container.
4. Transport evidence to digital forensics lab.

#Steps to be followed at digital lab includes
1. Retrieve digital evidence from the secure container (Step 3 above)
2. Create a forensic copy of the evidence: use a tool to get a copy of the evidence to avoid modifying the original data
3. Return the digital evidence to the secure container: Work off the copy of the digital evidence. If broken, you make another copy
from original to work on.
4. Start processing the copy from your workstation.

Digital Forensics according to Ken Zatyko includes:
- Proper search authority: Investigators having proper legal authority to search
- Chain of custody: Required to have a record of who is holding the evidence at anytime.
- Validation with mathematics: Using mathematical function called hash function to know if a FILE has not been modified.
- Use of validated tools: Tools used in the investigation must be validated. All tools must be working properly
- Repeatability: Establish a way to make the findings reproduceable based on skills and tools available.
- Reporting: Conclude the investigation with a report.

#Using DF to search for a kidnapped cat
- A cat was kidnapped
- Kidnapper sent a MS word document to make their request.
- The MS Word document got converted to PDF to extract image for convenience.
- Changed directory to the directory containing the case file by running " cd /root/Rooms/introdigitalforensics"
- Run "ls" to view what the directory contains.
- Note for document metadata in MS Word document or PDF, you can follow the below steps
  - MS Word
    - Select the "View" tab at the top
    - Go to the extreme right and select "Properties"
    - Under "Properties", you will see info like Title, Last Modified, Last Created, Printed, Author, Last Modified by, Pages, etc.
  - PDF
    - Select "setting" (the gear icon) at the extreme right at the top
    - Select "view document properties"
    - You will see properties like Author, Title, Created on, Modified on, Creator, Location, Subject etc.
- We can also run some commands to view the pdf metatdata. Run "pdfinfo $Document_name". If you don't have pdfinfo installed on KaliLinux
Run "sudo apt install poppler-utils"
- Enter the "Author" that you found in the metadata running the command in the previous step
- Run the command "exiftool $IMAGE_NAME" to get info embedded the image- metadata e.g location. If you don't have exiftool installed, run
"sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl" to isntall it on Kali Linux.
