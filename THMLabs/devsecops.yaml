####Devsecops on thm focuses on securing pipelines throuh Iac and extends to containerization security.
#secure software development workflow
#Objectives
#Into to Devsecops(Secure SDLC, environments and tools)
#SDLC
#SSDLC(Secure Software Development LifeCycle)
#Security of Pipeline(Pipeline automation, Source code security, Automated Code Testing, Dependency Management, CI/CD and Environment Security)
#Security in the pipeline (Attacking the pipeline, Exploiting vulnerabilities in the pipeline, Defending the pipeline)
#Container security
#Infrastructure as Code (Cloud Devops, secret management, exploiting terraform, exploiting vagrant, exploiting docker)
- Agile: The methodology that relies on self-organizing teams that focus on constructive collaboration
- DevOps: The methodology that relies on AUTOMATION and INTEGRATION to drive cultural change and unite teams.
- Waterfall: The traditional approach to project management that led to MISTRUST and POOR COMMUNICATION between developmental teams.
DevOps emphasises "BUILDING TRUST"
- CI/CD: Helps in adding tests in an automated manner and dealing with frequent merging of code changes.
- MONITORING: Focuses on collecting data to analyse the performance and stability of services.
- IAC: A way to provision infrastructure through reusable and consistent code.
- Shift Left: DevOps teams focus on instilling SECURITY from the earliest stages in the development lifecycle and establishes a more
collaborative culture between DEVELOPMENT and SECURITY.
Benefits:
- Risks are reduced massively because security is introduced early in the SDLC
- No unnecessary stress because bug are discovered in later stages of SDLC s before
- No constant rollbacks because bugs are discovered in later stages
- No economic losses as a result of discovering security flaws or bugs late.
- Security flaws are discovered in early stages and these prevent stress, rollbacks and economic losses.
Implementing security at every stages of the SDLC will ensure the software is designed with security best practices.
The practice of SHIFTING LEFT in DevOps is called DEVSECOPS(Development approach whereby security is introduced from the early stages of development
lifecycle until the final stages).
Security is no more an add-on, it is a MUST DESIGN FEATURE.
