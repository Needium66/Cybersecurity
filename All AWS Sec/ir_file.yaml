Intro:
This is workplan or roadmap for incident response in AWS based on their incident response whitepaper
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/aws-security-incident-response-guide.pdf#aws-security-incident-response-guide
AWS Shared Responsibility Model on Security: AWS will be RESPONSIBLE for security OF the cloud
Customer will be RESPONSIBLE for security IN the cloud i.e you will have FULL CONTROL of your security implementation e.g access to TOOLS
and SERVICES in your AWS environment. With this, you can establish a SECURITY BASELINE for your AWS environment.
What you will need to know as customer
How to RESPOND or INVESTIGATE: If there is a DEVIATION from the BASELINE e.g a misconfiguration or external factors.
Controls: Controls that you can use for security
Capabilities: Capabilities that you can use for security
Automation: How to use automation for remediation purposes for after an incident to improve RESPONSE SPEED and CONSISTENCY
Compliance and Regulatory requirements: on how to build an incident response program.

Aspects of AWS Incident Response Overview (Cloud)
The incident response that is carried out in the cloud is different from the traditional on-premises incident response.
The aspects that are focussed on for incident response in AWS are i.e the processes that are needed to be followed to have an effective
incident response plan includes:
Preparation: Prepare your team on how to DETECT and RESPOND to incidents within AWS using DETECTIVE CONTROLS and VERIFYING ACCESS to TOOLS
and CLOUD SERVICES. Prepare a MANUAL and AUTOMATED PLAYBOOKS to verify reliable and consistent responses
Operations: Carry out security events and incident response using NISTs phases of incident response- i.e use NISTS phases to carry out operations
on security events and potential incidents - use DACER (Detect, Analyze Contain, Eradicate, Recover)
Post-Incident Activity(PIA): Iterate based on the outcome of SECURITY EVENTS or SIMULATIONS and improve the efficacy of your plan for response
and investigation in order to REDUCE the risk.
Flow: This aligns with NIST flow too              Preparation ------ Operations (Detection&Analysis)+(Containment&Eradication)---PIA
POP (aspects) for short
NIST SP 800-61  - The current version
AWS Incident Response Principles and Design Goals:
Establish response objectives: Work with stakeholders on how to respond to incidents. Goals like 
1)Containing and mitigating the issue
2)Recovering the affected resources
3)Preserving data for forensics
4)Returning to known safe operations
5)Learn from incidents
Respond using the cloud: Implement your plan in the cloud
Know what you have and what you need: Preserve LOGS, RESOURCES, SNAPSHOTS and OTHER EVIDENCE by storing and copying them in a centralized location
You can use tags , metadata
Use redeployment mechanisms: You can redeploy to remediate if an anomaly is due to misconfigurations.
Automate where possible: Automate where possible to make everything fast and effective
Choose scalable solutions: Build a response plan that is scalable across environments.
Learn and improve your process: Iterate as you progress.

CLOUD SECURITY INCIDENT DOMAINS
There are 3 domains within customer's responsibility where incidents can occur. The domains will require different TOOLS,KNOWLEDGE and RESPONSE
Service: Incidents in service domain may affect AWS ACCOUNT, IAM PERMISSIONS, RESOURCE METADATA, BILLING etc It has to with responding through
AWS API mechanisms, root causes associated with configuration or resource permissions, service-oriented logging.
Infrastructure: It may affect DATA or NETWORK RELATED ACTIVITY e.g processes and data on EC2, traffic to EC2 instances within VPC
Application: Occurs in the application code or software deployed to the services or infrastructure.

PREPARATION: To prepare for INCIDENTS, you csn do that across these 3 domains-
People: Identify the necessary stakeholders for incident response and train them on INCIDENT RESPONSE and CLOUD TECHNOLOGIES.
Define roles and responsibilities for HR, EXECUTIVE, LEGAL, DEVELOPERS/OWNERS OF THE APPLICATION, CLOUD ADMINISTRATOR. Train STAFF
on the technologies that are being used, run GAMEDAY or SIMULATIONS occassionally. Understand AWS technologies and environments.
Document your AWS environments and make it accessible. Use AWS Customer Incident Response Team (CIRT) support if needed.
DDoS Response Support- Use Amazon Shield, which provides a managed protection of Ddos and safeguards web apps running on AWS
AWS Managed Service(AMS)- It provides ongoing management of AWS infrastructure. AMS automates activities like CHANGE REQUESTS, MONITORING
PATCH MANAGEMENT, SECURITY, and BACKUP SERVICES.
Process: Set up processes, by DOCUMENTING ARCHITECTURE, DEVELOP incident response plan and CREATE PLAYBOOKS for consistent IR.
Have clear steps and workflows to manage response to security incidents. Update, Iterate, and Test your incident response processes.
Develop an INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN document. Your incident response plan document should have these sections:
1) An incident response team overview
2) Roles and responsibilities
3) A communication plan
4) Phases of incident response and action to take
5) Incident severity and pripritization definition
Document and centralize architectural diagrams.
AWS account structure - You need to know:
• How many AWS accounts do you have?
• How are those AWS accounts organized?
• Who are the business owners of the AWS accounts?
• Do you use Service Control Policies (SCPs)? If so, what organizational guardrails are implemented by
using SCPs?
• Do you limit the regions and services that can be used?
• What differences are there between business units and environments (dev/test/prod)?
AWS service patterns:
• What AWS services do you use?
• What are the most widely used AWS services?
Architecture patterns:
• What cloud architectures do you use?
AWS authentication patterns:
• How do your developers typically authenticate to AWS?
• Do you use IAM roles or users (or both)? Is your authentication to AWS connected to an identity
provider (IdP)?
• How do you map an IAM role or user to an employee or system?
• How does access get revoked when someone is no longer authorized?
AWS authorization patterns:
• What IAM policies do your developers use?
• Do you use resource-based policies?
Logging and monitoring:
• What logging sources do you use and where are they stored?
• Do you aggregate AWS CloudTrail logs? If so, where are they stored?
• How do you query CloudTrail logs?
• Do you have Amazon GuardDuty enabled?
• How do you access GuardDuty findings (for example, console, ticketing system, SIEM)?
• Are findings or events aggregated in a SIEM?
• Are tickets automatically created?
• What tooling is in place to analyze logs for an investigation?
Network topology:
• How are devices, endpoints, and connections on your network physically or logically arranged?
• How does your network connect with AWS?
• How is network traffic filtered between en11vironments?
External infrastructure:
• How are externally facing application deployed?
• What AWS resources are publicly accessible?
• What AWS accounts contain infrastructure that is externally facing?
• What DDoS or external filtering is there?
Develop Incident Response Playbooks-
What to include in playbooks:
Playbook overview What risk or incident scenario does this playbook address? What is the goal of
the playbook?
• Prerequisites What logs and detection mechanisms are required for this incident scenario? What is
the expected notification?
• Stakeholder information  Who is involved and what is their contact information? What are each of
the stakeholders responsibilities?
• Response steps  Across phases of incident response, what tactical steps should be taken? What
queries should an analyst run? What code should be run to achieve the desired outcome?
• Detect-  How will the incident be detected?
• Analyze-  How will the scope of impact be determined?
• Contain-  How will the incident be isolated to limit scope?
• Eradicate-  How will the threat be removed from the environment?
• Recover- How will the affected system or resource be brought back into production?
• Expected- outcomes After queries and code are run, what is the expected result of the playbook?
Run regular simulations- You MIMICK threat actor's techniques and procedures (TTPs), then you respond to this mock cyber event.
Types of simulations:
Tabletop exercises- It is a discussion based one, where stakeholders will discuss the roles etc. Done in a day. It focusses on processes, people and collaborations.
Purple team exercises- It increases the collaboration between the INCIDENT RESPONDERS(Blue team) and SIMULATED THREAT ACTORS(Red team)
Blue team generally comprises of SOC and maybe other stakeholders and read team comprises of PENETRATION TESTING TEAM or KEY STAKEHOLDERS
trained in OFFENSIVE SECURITY.
Red team exercises- Red team conducts a SIMULATION with certain objectives from a pre-determined scope. The blue team may not have info about 
the scope or the duration. So this exercise seems to provide a more REALISTIC ASSESSMENT. You should however be cautions that it does not provide damage to your environment security posture
STEPS FOR SIMULATIONS: The regular steps in which simulation follows:
1) Define core exercise elements- define the simulation scenarios and objectives of it and get it approved by the leadership
2) Identify key stakeholders- identify key stakeholders- legal, HR, communications and executive leadership
3) Build and test scenarios- you may need to REDINE scenarios while testing
4) Facilitate the simulation- the type of exercise will determine the facilitation- paer-based or not or less
5) Develop the after action report(AAR)- Identify areas that went well, those that needs improvements, the gaps and build on that for the future.
Technology: Set up access, AGGREGATE and MONITOR LOGS, IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE ALERT MECHANISMS and DEVELOP RESPONSE and INVESTIGATIVE
CAPABILITIES.
Follow these for technology- I call this blueprint. Because this is exactly how our cloud environment is structured out.
DEVELOP AWS ACCOUNT STRUCTURE: Use AWS Organizations. OUs to group accounts together, to ADMINISTER as a single unit.
For IR, it is important to have an ACCOUNT that supports the functions of IR(security OU and forensic OU) Have accounts for:
1) Log archival- Aggregate logs in this account e.g Central account or Master account or IR account
2) Security tooling- It operates as a delegated admin for security services e.g Master account or Infra or Admin etc
Accounts for each region that you operate in e.g us-east-1 and us-west-2 or us-east-2 and us-west-2. Structure of sample account
                                        Organization Root
                        Security OU                                 Forensic OU
          Security Tooling Account   Log Archival Account      Forensics Region 1   Forensics Region 2
DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A TAGGING STRATEGY: Have all resources in your AWS tagged maybe based on environment, application, purpose, version etc
UPDATE AWS ACCOUNT INFO: Have accurate and up-to-date contact info in each of your aws accounts. Have primary and alternate contacts for
SECURITY, BILLING and OPERATIONS. Use a DL to avoid problems emanating from using just one person's email
PREPARE ACCESS TO AWS ACCOUNTS: Ensure your team have access to appropriate environments before an event occurs. Know the access that is required
and provide least privilege access.
UNDERSTAND THE THREAT LANDSCAPE:
Develop threat models- This can help to identify attack vectors a threat actor may have. Understanding what threat you are defending against
will be crucial to responding in a timely manner.
Integrate and use cyber threat intelligence- Cyber threat intelligence includes- IP addresses or file hashes of malware, behavioral pattern
and intent. You can use tools like AWS GuardDuty, DNS Firewall, AWS WAF
SELECT AND SET UP LOGS FOR ANALYSIS AND ALERTING: Select and enable log sources that are relevant to AWS workload. AWS Cloudtrail is ENABLED
by default with 90-day management event retention that can be retrieved via Event History in Cloudtrail.
If you need a retention of more than 90 days, you will need to set up a CLOUDTRAIL integrated with S3 bucket and optionally with Cloudwatch log group.
Or set a Cloudtrail Lake (which retains cloudtrail logs up to 7 years and provide SQL query based facility)
If you are using VPC and DNS logs, it is recommended to use VPC Flow Logs(can be used for VPC, subnet or network interface) and Route 53 Resolver Query Logs and STREAM them to an S3 bucket
or Cloudwatch log group.
VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail and Route 53 resolver query logs are the TRIFECTA of logging for incidents investigation in AWS
