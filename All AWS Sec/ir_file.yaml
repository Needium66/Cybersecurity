Intro:
This is workplan or roadmap for incident response in AWS based on their incident response whitepaper
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/aws-security-incident-response-guide.pdf#aws-security-incident-response-guide
AWS Shared Responsibility Model on Security: AWS will be RESPONSIBLE for security OF the cloud
Customer will be RESPONSIBLE for security IN the cloud i.e you will have FULL CONTROL of your security implementation e.g access to TOOLS
and SERVICES in your AWS environment. With this, you can establish a SECURITY BASELINE for your AWS environment.
What you will need to know as customer
How to RESPOND or INVESTIGATE: If there is a DEVIATION from the BASELINE e.g a misconfiguration or external factors.
Controls: Controls that you can use for security
Capabilities: Capabilities that you can use for security
Automation: How to use automation for remediation purposes for after an incident to improve RESPONSE SPEED and CONSISTENCY
Compliance and Regulatory requirements: on how to build an incident response program.

Aspects of AWS Incident Response Overview (Cloud)
The incident response that is carried out in the cloud is different from the traditional on-premises incident response.
The aspects that are focussed on for incident response in AWS are i.e the processes that are needed to be followed to have an effective
incident response plan includes:
Preparation: Prepare your team on how to DETECT and RESPOND to incidents within AWS using DETECTIVE CONTROLS and VERIFYING ACCESS to TOOLS
and CLOUD SERVICES. Prepare a MANUAL and AUTOMATED PLAYBOOKS to verify reliable and consistent responses
Operations: Carry out security events and incident response using NISTs phases of incident response- i.e use NISTS phases to carry out operations
on security events and potential incidents - use DACER (Detect, Analyze Contain, Eradicate, Recover)
Post-Incident Activity(PIA): Iterate based on the outcome of SECURITY EVENTS or SIMULATIONS and improve the efficacy of your plan for response
and investigation in order to REDUCE the risk.
Flow: This aligns with NIST flow too              Preparation ------ Operations (Detection&Analysis)+(Containment&Eradication)---PIA
POP (aspects) for short
NIST SP 800-61  - The current version
AWS Incident Response Principles and Design Goals:
Establish response objectives: Work with stakeholders on how to respond to incidents. Goals like 
1)Containing and mitigating the issue
2)Recovering the affected resources
3)Preserving data for forensics
4)Returning to known safe operations
5)Learn from incidents
Respond using the cloud: Implement your plan in the cloud
Know what you have and what you need: Preserve LOGS, RESOURCES, SNAPSHOTS and OTHER EVIDENCE by storing and copying them in a centralized location
You can use tags , metadata
Use redeployment mechanisms: You can redeploy to remediate if an anomaly is due to misconfigurations.
Automate where possible: Automate where possible to make everything fast and effective
Choose scalable solutions: Build a response plan that is scalable across environments.
Learn and improve your process: Iterate as you progress.

CLOUD SECURITY INCIDENT DOMAINS
There are 3 domains within customer's responsibility where incidents can occur. The domains will require different TOOLS,KNOWLEDGE and RESPONSE
Service: Incidents in service domain may affect AWS ACCOUNT, IAM PERMISSIONS, RESOURCE METADATA, BILLING etc It has to with responding through
AWS API mechanisms, root causes associated with configuration or resource permissions, service-oriented logging.
Infrastructure: It may affect DATA or NETWORK RELATED ACTIVITY e.g processes and data on EC2, traffic to EC2 instances within VPC
Application: Occurs in the application code or software deployed to the services or infrastructure.
