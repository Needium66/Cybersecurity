Intro:
This is workplan or roadmap for incident response in AWS based on their incident response whitepaper
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/aws-security-incident-response-guide.pdf#aws-security-incident-response-guide
AWS Shared Responsibility Model on Security: AWS will be RESPONSIBLE for security OF the cloud
Customer will be RESPONSIBLE for security IN the cloud i.e you will have FULL CONTROL of your security implementation e.g access to TOOLS
and SERVICES in your AWS environment. With this, you can establish a SECURITY BASELINE for your AWS environment.
What you will need to know as customer
How to RESPOND or INVESTIGATE: If there is a DEVIATION from the BASELINE e.g a misconfiguration or external factors.
Controls: Controls that you can use for security
Capabilities: Capabilities that you can use for security
Automation: How to use automation for remediation purposes for after an incident to improve RESPONSE SPEED and CONSISTENCY
Compliance and Regulatory requirements: on how to build an incident response program.

and CLOUD SERVICES. Prepare a MANUAL and AUTOMATED PLAYBOOKS to verify reliable and consistent responses
