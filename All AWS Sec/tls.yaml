#AWS was phasing out the usage of TLS 1.0 and 1.2
#This is focused on appropriately disabling tls 1.1 or lower on some resources or apps that are currently using it
#Found out some apps were still using tls 1.1 or lower
#Needs to turn on dataevents for cloudtrail logs and run a query to see what is using the phased out tls
