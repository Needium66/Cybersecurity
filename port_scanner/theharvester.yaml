#run "theharvester" on your machine- this is used to gather information.
#run "theharvester -d tesla.com -l 500 -b google" the d stands for domain, l stands for length of searches- 500
#-b means through google. It is going to look through it. It should find some emails and potential targets.
#it could find some subdomains, web addresses
#you will be doing this if you are on a red team- this is part of social engineering stuff- gathering info.
#you can check "haveibeenpwned" on google too. this tool is used to search for if your email address or phone number have been compromised.
#you can run some of the email addresses or phone numbers generated by the harvester to verify if they have been breached.
#the result will be either it shows it has been breached or not.
#to install bluto, run this command "pip install bluto"
#it is a DNS recon, brute force, zone transfer, wild card checks.

#it does haveibeenpwned for you too- compromised account enumeration
