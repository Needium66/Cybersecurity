#PFSENSE CONFIGURATION (Configured pfsense for my homelab)
#pfsense is a free and open source firewall and router, used as threat management, load balancing, WAN (Wide Area Network) and others
#ARCHITECTURE
#To configure pfsense as a firewall that enables the network segmentation that only allows controlled traffic for security purposese.g my home network.
#The intent of this is to use it as firewall for my homelab. This can be replicated by an enterprise too.
#pfsense download- download pfs from this link-https://www.pfsense.org/download/
#Follow the below instructions/steps to complete the download
1. From pfsense landing page, select "AMD64(64-bit)" as the "Architecture" of the latest version

3. Select the default "Mirror" (For me it is "Austin, TX USA")
4. Select the "Download" button to download the file
#Configure pfsense on the vm workstation after the download
1. Access the vm workstation
2. From "Home", navigate to "Create a New Virtual Machine" and select it.
3. Go to the "Browse" button and select your pfsense file from the location where it is saved on your local machine,
4. Select the "Next" button at the bottom.
5. Enter a name for your virtual machine in "Virtual machine name" e.g pfsense_homelab
6. Select the "Next" button at the bottom
7. Select "Next"
8. Select "Customize hardware" to configure your preferences. My preferences are
  a. 2GB RAM I.e increase the "Virtual machine memory" from the default to 2GB

  "Network Adapter" one at a time (5x) and click on the "Finish" button one at a time(5x) (NAT is needed to support the other machines that will be
  be used for pfsense)
  c. Assign "Custom virtual network" toe each of the 6 NATs, by selecting a NAT from the left, then select "Custom specific virtual network" from
  the section displayed on the right. Ensure the NAT number matches the custom specific virtual network e.g if NAT is 1, the custom specific
  virtual network must be VMnet1. Repeat same for the remaining 5.
  d. Select "Sound Card" on the left and click on "Remove" button below to remove it.
  e. Click on "Close" button at the bottom on the right to complete your customization and go back to complete your new vm creation

  b. Enter "no" for "should vlan be set up now"
  c. Enter your "WAN interface name".(the name of your WAN seen in step 15)
  d. Enter your "LAN interface name". (the name of your LAN seen in step 15)
  e. Enter the "Optional 1 - 5 Interface name" ( e.g enter em1 to em5 one at a time based on what the name is on your screen)
  f. Enter yes for "do you want to proceed" (enter "y")- could take couple of seconds or minutes to be completed.
  g. Once completed, it should display configurations according to what you have specified
16. Enter options for assigning IPs to your interfaces for the next "Enter an option". (It is going to be the number for "Set Interface(s) IP address")
e.g if it is 2, enter it and if it is 3, enter 3. It will display "Available Interfaces" for you.
17. Select the "LAN interface" as the first "Enter the number of the interface you want to configure". (If LAN is on 3, enter 3)
  a. Enter the IP of your LAN in the "Enter the new LAN IPV4 address" e. 192.#.#.#
  b. Enter the new LAN IPV4 subnet e.g 24
  c. Enter the new LAN IPV4 upstream gateway . select "ENTER" for this. You don't need gateway except you use it in your network
  d. Enter the new LAN IPV6 address if you use or have it (I don't)
  e. Enter "y" for "do you want to enable DHCP server on your LAN"
  f. Enter the start address of the IPV4 client address range that you use- e,g 192.#.#.#
  g. Enter the end addres of the IPV4 client address range that you use e.g 192.#.#.#
  h. Enter "n" for "do you want to revert to HTTP for your webconfiguration protocol"
  i. It will display what your LAN is set at now- The LAN ip that you have specified in step 17a with the subnet in step 17b and state that
  you can now access webconfiguration by opening the a url in your broowser e.g https://192.#.#.#
  j. Select "ENTER" to continue.
18. Enter "2" for "Enter and option"
19. Select the next interface to configure the rest of your interfaces in "Enter the number of the interface you wish to configure" e.g 2
  a. Enter a specified IP for "Enter the new OPT1 IPV4 address"
  b. Enter a specified subnet for "Enter the new OPT1 IPV4 subnet address" e.g 24
  c. Click on "ENTER" for IPV6
  d. Enter "n" for "Enter the new OPT1 IPV4 new DHCP"
  e. Enter "n" for "do you want to revert to HTTP for your webconfiguration protocol"
20. Enter "2" for "Enter an option"
21. Select the next interface to configure the rest of your interfaces in "Enter the number of the interface you wish to configure" e.g 4 
  a. Enter a specified IP for "Enter the new OPT2 IPV4 address" (#because of the OPT2- it could be 192.168.2.1)
  b. Enter a specified subnet for "Enter the new OPT2 IPV4 subnet address" e.g 24
  c. Click on "ENTER" for IPV6
  d. Enter "n" for "Enter the new OPT2 IPV4 new DHCP"
  e. Enter "n" for "do you want to revert to HTTP for your webconfiguration protocol"
22 . #we need to leave an option without an IP address so that it can be the port with traffic that the security engine can be monitoring from the network
So you can skip one of the interfaces, then select the next e.g skip option 5 and go to option 6 to configure.
23. Select the next interface to configure the rest of your interfaces in "Enter the number of the interface you wish to configure" e.g 4 
  a. Enter a specified IP for "Enter the new OPT4 IPV4 address" (#because of the OPT4- it could be 192.168.4.1)
  b. Enter a specified subnet for "Enter the new OPT4 IPV4 subnet address" e.g 24
  c. Click on "ENTER" for IPV6
  d. Enter "n" for "Enter the new OPT4 IPV4 new DHCP"
  e. Enter "n" for "do you want to revert to HTTP for your webconfiguration protocol"
  f. Allow it to complete
#Now we have all the configurations for the pfsense
#This was achieved in 23 focal steps as part of configuration labs for my cybersecurity detection and monitoring lab.
