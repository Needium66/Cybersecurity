#Security onion configuration
#The intent is to use security onion as an ids (intrusion detection system) and log management solution
#An ids is a network security technology that MONITORS network traffic and looks for suspicious activities. 
#Built for detecting vulnerabilityexploits against a target application or computer. 
#It is a LISTEN-ONLY device. 
#It MONITORS traffic and REPORTS results to an admin.
#You can connect it to a tool or any endpoint to collect traffic
#For example,in my case, I am connecting it to pfsense to,so that it can be collecting traffic from it and monitor or log for suspicious activities
