your container configurations are secure by default, or detect any misconfigurations.
Cloud hosted platform connected via an API to the major public cloud providers. Org integrates with an identity and cloud providers.
Org also integrates with 3rd party ticketing, notification and SIEM tools to provide visibility and remediation
Benefits
- Manage and visualize: Agentless scanning, multi cloud visibility and smart search and query
- Assess and Prioritize Risks: Identity compute, data, network, infrastructure
- Detect and Respond: Behavioral anomalies, enriched data
- Ensure compliance and governance: Compliance standards, org policies, JIT
- Remediated and Shift Left: Automatic remediation, IaC sec, Ticketing and workflows.
#Ticketing and ITSM - Jira, ServiceNow. Collaboration: Slack, Teams. SIEM: Datadog, QRadar, Splunk. Data Security: Dig Security
#Reprting in TCS could be
#One-time or scheduled
#Multiple report types available: Inventory, Misconfigurations, Compliance reports, Open Findings
# CSV or PDF format

Dashboard:
The navigation pane on the left shows the Dashboard, Inventory, Findings, Compliance, IAM, Workload Protection, IaC, JIT, Policies, Reports
Provides comprehensive overview of your cloud environment. The counts of assets. Then leads you to where you can investigate risky events in
your environment. You can use it to provide a quick overview of activities to executives. To monitor and drill down to 
You can configure findings to what you prefer. You can enable compliance to be last 7 days. Use Toxic combinations for resources with
multiple risk factors/stats. Then section that shows what to do to REMEDIATE risks in your environment.
You can filter based on accounts you want to see from the top right. But by default, all accounts are displayed.
Asset Inventory:
From the navigation pane on the left, select "Inventory" and select the resource type- based on what you have e.g AWS, GCP, Azure AD, Google workspace.
Select Azure AD for example, it will show the Admin Roles, Application Registrations, Applications, Groups, Secrets and Certificates, Users.
e.g all privileged users that have sensitive access but not used for a while.  Filters are available from the top. e.g Select "Last sihn-inselect "User Type"
Select "Guest", From "Last Azure Activity" dropdown, select "Date". From the "Label" dropdown, select "Sensitive". Select the resource from what
is populated. Info about the resource, Findings about the resource. Permissions from Azure Permission tab. Click on "Activity Log" to see
the breakdown of the resource. To export it, click on "Export" tab at the far right and have it as CSV or whatever format you want.
Activity Log:
Select "Activity Log" from the navigation pane on your left. Use the filters at the top, to select the scope of the activity log. e.g
Select the "Action" filter. Use the search box to find a specfic type e.g "List Object". Slect it to apply it. To see all actions that did
not make it through, select "Filter out Success". You can click on the JSON view on the right to view the raw logs in JSON format.
To export it to a csv file, click the top right.
Findings:
It represents at-risk identities and resources, and hard-to-spot toxic combinations. Are listed in order of severity of the potential threat
to your cloud environment. To group findings in a particular account, click the Group by Finding Type at the top and select "Account".
You can use the "Filter" at the top to narrow down the results to critical only. Select "Severity", Critical, Policy- Overprivileged IAM role
Click findings to see more reasons- why the severity was critical. Click permissions/usage to see permission mapping. Review steps for
remediation. Next, Apply or Cancel. Terraform or Cloudformation file to deploy can be selected at the bottom.
Policies:
Select "Policies" from the left side of the navigation menu. By default, the entire organization is selected. Select an account scope
from the "Organization" on the left to view and manage compliance policies for a specific subset of cloud accounts.
Click one of the out of the box policies, selct "SHOW MORE" under it. You can apply fiter from the top for a specific categories or
to narrow the scopes. e.g to see policies with "failed" result in AWS. Select "Cloud" filter and select "AWS". Select the "Result" filter
and select "Failure". To export the result in CSV format, clik the "Export" button at the top right corner of the policies table
Click the "Gear" icon on the right to open the Policy Settings page. You can enable or disable it. or delay the policy creation findings.
Use the exclusions menu to exclude the policies. There are existing templates you can use. From the top right corner of the policy page, click
on "Add Custom Policy" button, select "Cloud Provider". Select a template category from the left. Select the template you want to use for the policy
Click "NEXT". On the policy "Name", give it a name and description. Add severity for it. Select when policy should be applied. When finished,
click "Done" or "X".
When you click the result of a policy, you will brought to "Findings" page.
Reports:
You can create a one-time report or scheduled report of TCS data.
Click "Reports" from the left side navigation menu
Select a scope from the "Organization" tree on the left.
Click "New report" button on the right.
Select a report type from the drop down e.g compliance.
Click Type to open the drop down list and select an appropriate type e.g AWS or EKS or GCP etc.
