#Discovery:
#you can change the "Scan Type" from "Common Port" to "All ports"
#This will scan all ports, use netstat credentials that are provided, use SYN scanner too.
#the hosts that are going to be used are TCP, ARP and ICMP (twice)

#Assessment- Go to assessment
#You can leave as "Default" or select "Scan for all vulnerabilities"(this may be too complex, so you may do without selecting it)

#Note: Web assessment is different from pen testing. you can do all cross-site scripting and sql injection for web assessment.
