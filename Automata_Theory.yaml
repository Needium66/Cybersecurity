FINITE AUTOMATA
A finite automation is a collection of 3 things
1) A finite set of states( one is designated as INITIAL STATE (START STATE) and some or NONE, designated as FINAL STATES.)
2) An alphabet of possible input letters.
3) A finite set of TRANSITIONS that tell for each state and for each letter of the input alphabet which state to go next.
