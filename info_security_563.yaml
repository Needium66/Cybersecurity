#Ojectives
#Main computing assets and security
#Main security goals known as CIA triad
#What are the computing assets to be protected?
1. Hardware
2. Software
3. Data
Hardware: Includes Computer, Devices (disk drives, memory, printer), Network gear
Software: Includes OS, Utilities (antivirus), Commercial applications (word processing, photo editing) and individual applications.
Data: Documents, Photos, music videos, email, class projects.

#Security Goals- CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability)
Confidentiality: It is the avoidance of unauthorized disclosure of info. It involves the PROTECTION OF DATA, providing ACCESS to those who are allowed to see it
and disallowing others from leaning anything about its content.
Tools of confidentialy: i.e tools that are used to ensure confidentiality
1. Encryption
2. Authentication
3. Access control and support
Encryption: it is the transformation of info using a secret (an encryption key), so that the TRANSFORMED INFO can only be read using
another key (a decryption key). In some cases the decryption key can be the same as encryption key. i.e the encryption key will
TRANSFORM the info into something that cannot be read or deciphered by anybody except when the decryption key is used. can only see ciphertext

Sender (encrypt it with a key)..........> ciphertext(unreadable by attackers)..............>Receiver(decrypt to a plain text)
Authentication: used to determine the identity or role that a user has. The DETERMINATION can be done in a different ways BUT there could be comb
ination of ways. The different ways include-
- something the person has (e.g a smart card or radio key fob storing keys)
- something the person knows (password)
- something the person is e.g fingerprint of a human
Access control: rules and policies that LIMIT access to confidential info for people and/or systems with a "need to know"
Need to know can be determined by:
- Identity: e.g a person's NAME or COMPUTER SERIAL NUMBER
- Role: e.g a person's role e.g a MANAGER or SECURITY ENGINEER

Authorization: It is the DETERMINATION if a person or system is allowed access to resources, based on an access control policy.
Physical security: It is the ESTABLISHMENT of physical barriers to LIMIT access to PROTECTED RESOURCES. e.g use of sound dampening materials
putting computers in windowless rooms, locks on cabinets and doors, construction of buildings or rooms with walls incorporating copper
meshes.

Integrity: It means having info not be altered in unauthorized way.
Integrity Tools Include:
1. Backups
2. Checksums
3. Data correcting codes
Backups: Periodic archiving of data
Checksums: the computation of a function that MAPS the contents of a file to a NUMERICAL VALUE. It is designed in a way that a SMALL CHANGE
in the INPUT FILE( e.g flipping a single bit) is highly likely to result in a DIFFERENT OUTPUT VALUE.
Data correcting codes: methods of storing data in such a way that small changes can be easily detected and automatically corrected. e.g AWS Config

Availability: It means that info is ACCESSIBLE and MODIFIABLE in a timely fashion by those authorized to do so.
Availability tools include:
1. Physical protections
2. Computational redundancies
Physical protections: infrastructure meant to keep info available even in the event of physical challenges
Computational redundancies: computers and storage devices that serve as backups or disaster recovery in the case of failures
Other Security Concepts Triple A- A.A.A
- Authenticity
- Anonymity
- Assurance
Assurance: it refers to how TRUST is PROVIDED and MANAGED in computer systems.
Trust managements depends on: 
Policies
Permissions
Protections
Policies: it specifies the behavioural expectations that people or systems have for themselves and others. e.g the designer of an online
music system can specify the way users can access and copy songs
Permissions: it describes the behaviors that are allowed by the AGENTS that interact with a person or system. e.g an online music store
can provide limited access and copying to people that have purchased certain songs
Protections: mechanisms put in place to ensure permissions and policies e.g an online music store providing protections to prevent people
from unauthorized access and copying of its songs.
Authenticity: is the ABILITY to DETERMINE that statements, policies, and permissions issued by persons or systems are GENUINE
Authenticity Tools:
- Digital signatures e.g on atm card or cards.
Anonymity: that certain RECORD S or TRANSACTIONS not to be attributable to any individual.
Anonymity Tools:
1. Aggregation
2. Mixing
3. Proxies
4. Pseudonyms
Aggregation: Combining of data from many individuals so that disclosed sums or averages CANNOT be tied to any individual
Mixing: The intertwining of transactions, info, or communications in a way that cannot be traced to any individual
Proxies: Trusted agents that are willing to engage in actions for an individual in such a way that it cannot be traced back to that person
Pseudonyms: Fictional identities that can fill in for real identities in communications and transactions (trusted identity) e.g user id
