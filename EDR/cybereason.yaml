#There are several Endpoint Detection and Response tools. Cybereason is one of the most important EDR tool subscribed too by enterprises
#It monitors end-user devices to detect and respond to cyber threats e.g ransomware, malware etc.
#To cover some fundamentals and basics of it
#How to carry out a weekly status review of endpoints
#How to add new endpoints/devices
#How to investigate/troubleshoot
#How to configure cybereason
#Some other EDR tools include Crowdstrike, Checkpoint, Trellix, IBM QRadar EDR etc

#Weekly status reveiw for a new machine that has not made it to the "Group" yet
#This is to validate that all devices/endpoints/laptops etc that are running are being scanned, monitored by cybereason
#Any new machine that is found not to be in the "Group", should be added accordingly. The precursor to this is the installation of cybereason
#agent on the machine
#Follow the below steps to know the machines that are unassigned-
1. Access the cybereason portal of your organization
2. Select the "Menu" or bread crumb on the left at the top (usually has EPP overview)
3. Go to "Admin" from the navigation pane on the left and select "System"
4. Select "Groups" tab at the top
5. Select "Unassigned" from the navigation pane on your left
6. Review and validate that there are no machines that have been added to Cybereason, but did not make it to this group.

#How to create new group
#You can assign your machines to different groups for seamless and review and management on cybereason
#All laptops can belong to a group called Laptops for Users.
#You can name your groups based on the environment in which a server is or the OS of the server or name of the machines etc.
#Follow the below steps to create a new group
1. Select the "Create new group" button at the top
2. Enter "Group name" for the group.
3. Enter a "Description" for the group
4. Select "Assignment logic" based on IP, FQDN, Organization, OS etc

6. Click on the "Create group" button at the bottom.

##How to carry out a weekly status review of endpoints
1. Go to "Systems" from the navigation pane on your left.
2. Select "Sensors" tab from the top
3. Filter the endpoints(sensors) by "Last Seen" (It should be a column at the extreme right)
4. Validate for machines that have not checked-in in at least 2 weeks.
5. Review and if there is a need to investigate, follow the below steps
  i. Select the specified machine
  ii. Click on the "dropdown" on the "Actions" tab at the top
  iii. Go to "Investigate" option and select
  iv. Take action based on instructions that you see e.g offline etc
6. If after a review, you have determined that a machine has been decommissioned, you can archive the machine from the list.
7. Follow the below steps to archive a machine-
  i. Select the specified machine
  ii. Click on the "dropdown" on the "Actions" tab at the top
  iii. Go to "Archive" option and select
  iv. Take action based on instructions that you see e.g enter a reason for the "Archive"
  v. Select the "Archive" button at the bottom.


#Data collection could be "Advanced" for all endpoints and just "Enabled" for servers. The difference between Advanced and Enabled are
#For Advanced, Anti-Ransomware is enabled. It prevemts signatures mode state, fileless mode is enabled.
#For both Advanced and Enbabled, a "Full Scan" and "Quick Scan" are performed at least once  a week. 
#You should be able to see when last the machine was scanned
#It can scan all the machines with the major OS (Windows, Linux, Mac etc)

#Phishing or Malware Links Attack
#If a user clicks on a bad link in the browser, take the below steps
1. Verify that the specific user is off vpn
2. Execute a Cybereason full scan
3. Initiate a force close of the tab with the bad link or the whole browser
4. Check for links used in the site settings -
  i for Chrome- go to settings/content/all?search=site
  ii. for edge- go to edge/settings/content/all?search=site%20permiss
5. Validate no suspicious software or extensions were isntalled.
6. Create a ticket to tract this
7. Report site to the following links
  i. Report an unsafe site for Microsoft
  ii. Google save browsing
8. Have the user change their password
9. Inform stakeholders

#If a user clicks on a phishing link

1. Validate that the specific user is off vpn
2. Execute a Cybereason full scan
3. Have the user change their password
4. Sign out of all active sessions
5. Validate no suspicious software or extensions were isntalled.
6. Create a ticket to tract this
7. Report email as phishing in outlook
9. Inform stakeholders
