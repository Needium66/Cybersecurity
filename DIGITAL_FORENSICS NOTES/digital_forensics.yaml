####this file is for notes curating my journey in the world of digital forensics
####it will be more structured, beginning with an introduction, then delves into other areas in digital forensics
####text to be used throughout this journey is digital forensics basics: a practical guide using windows os by nihad hassan


####introduction
# what is digital investigation
# why do we need digital investigation?
- the world has changed and evolved into dependence on electronic devices e.g phones, laptops etc.
- the world has gone digital with the prevalence of these devices and crimes are committed using these devices.
- therefore to be able to investigate crimes that are committed involving these devices, we will have to incorporate digitization.
###crime
#what is a crime?
- crime can be defined into 2 main groups
1) physical - does not involve electronics
2) digital
  - identity theft
  - cyberbullying
  - skimming
  - spoofing
  - accessing accounts
  - social engineering
3) electronic device that can be useful in crime investigation
  - commit the crime: you can use electronic device to commit a crime e.g wire fraud- credit card is involved
  - research on the internet: you can use electronic device to carry out research on the crime to be committed on the internet e.g laptop
  - communication: you can electronic device to communicate for a crime e.g phone
  - save files: you can use electronic device to save files of a crime e.g on a thumbdrive or file in a laptop
  - pictures: you can use electronic device to take pictures of who or what to commit a crime on e.g phone, camera etc
  - car phone location: your visited locations for a crime

#what are examples of crimes that require digital investiagtion?
- gilgo beach serial killer
- btk serial killer
  - lived in kansas
  - murdered 10 people between 1974 to 1991
  - sent taunting letters to police and newspapers
  - apprehended in 2005
  #how was he arrested?
  - could not arrest him through fingerprints or footprints etc
  - he was arrested using digital evidence: he used a floppy disk in the 90s
  - he sent a document to a tv station
  - the police were able to retrieve the disk and search for evidences on the floppy disk; the author, location, modification, date 
  metadataetc(properties)
  - they found a deleted word document file and recover it, author is dennis, traced to microsoft word that, located in the church(physical)
  - since the disk/ file is digital, it becomes a digital evidence

###locard's exchange principle
- every contact leaves a trace
- i.e there is always a trace of the suspect at every crime scene. because he interacts with the environment (crime scene) and leaves or
exchange  a trace e.g fingerprint, footprint, hair, piece of clothe (physical)
- applies to digital evidence:
   = login to your account
   - signed out of your account
   - gps
   - documents exchanged
   - sms
   - phone calls
   - saved files
   - sites visited
   - browser history

#####terms
# digital investigation
# digital forensics
# digital evidence

#digital investigation
- process of gathering or collecting evidence to answer questions about digital event e.g crime to test or hypothesize whether it is true
or not.
  - digital investigation using "scientific process"
    - the crime to investigate
    - ask questions - (what, who, how, where)
    - develop your hypothesis
    - gather evidence to proof or disproof hypothesis
    - repeat steps 3 and 4 until you find that the hypothesis is correct
    - document investigation for replications etc

#digital forensics
- usage of science  or technology in the investigation and establishments of facts or evidence in a court of law.

#digital evidence
- is any type of data that is saved or transferred using a digital device to aid the investigation
- digital evidence has:
  - legal usage
  - investigative usage
  - examples: face recognition, dna, surveillance video, camera, driver's license are all investigative usage
  - legal usage- is all about can it be used or not: federal uses it, but some states are not using some now.

#simulation
- crime: a murder is committed
- evidence: we have the victim's phone e.g sms
- what type of crime? it is physical crime, siince the victim was murdered
- we have digital evidence from the phone to aid in our investigation
- use the steps outlined above
    - the crime to investigate: murder using sms
    - ask questions - (what, who, how, where)
      - what was the victim's name?
      - who was the last person he communicated with?
      - how did he get to the crime scene?
      - where did the crime happen?
    - develop your hypothesis
      - first suspect committed the crime at the location (where) at time (when) based on sms
    - gather evidence to proof or disproof hypothesis
      - find files; investigate digital files, saved files, deleted files
      - images: face recognition, exchanged pictures
      - gps
      - test to proof or disproof
    - repeat steps 3 and 4 until you find that the hypothesis is correct
    - document investigation for replications etc
