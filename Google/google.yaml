#Define security- Prepare for storm- yet there are water leaks, prepare to mitigate the leaks or potential damage.
Cybersecurity (Security): Practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by protecting networks, devices,
people, and data from unathorized access or criminal exploitation. e.g
Requiring complex passwords to access sites and services to improve confidentiality against threat actors(pose danger or risk)
Benefits of security
Protects external(someone trying to gain access to private information, network or devices) or 
internal(current(accidental or accessing unathorized data) or former employee,  external vendors) threats
Maintain customers and partner trust
Maintain revenue once customers or partners trust are not lost

Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

#Roles

#Evolution of attacks
Virus: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software
It attaches itself to PROGRAM or DOCUMENT on a computer. Then it spreads and INFECTS one or more computers
An example of a computer virus is a WORM-It can SPREAD and DUPLICATE on its own without human involvement
Today, viruses are commonly known as MALWARE
Malware: Software designed to harm devices or networks
Two examples of  early Malware attacks:
Brain virus
Morris worm
Brain virus(1986): Alvi brothers created it. Its intention was to TRACK illegal copies of MEDICAL SOFTWARE and prevent PIRATED LICENSES.
But it turned out unexpectedly to- when someone used a pirated software, the VIRUS infected the computer. Then any disk inserted into the
computer will also be infected. Anytime anybody used the infected disks in a new computer, the VIRUS spread. Undetected, the VIRUS spread
globally in months. It changed the security industry-e emphasizing the need for plan and productivity.
Morris worm(1988): Robert Morris developed a program to access the SIZE OF THE INTERNET. The program CRAWLED the web and installed itself
onto other computers to tally the numbers of computers that were connected to the internet. The program however failed to keep TRACK of
the computers it had already COMPROMISED and continued to REINSTALL itself, until computers RAN OUT OF MEMORY and CRASHED.
About 6000 computers were affected-this represented 10% of the INTERNET at that time. Caused millions of dollars in damages
Computer Emergency Response Teams(CERTs): were established to respond to security incidents.
Disks are no ore needed to spread virus. Internet does it through the Malware now. Malware attacks:
Loveletter Attack
Equifax breach
Loveletter Attack(Onel de Guzman): 2000- Created the loveletter malware to STEAL internet login credentials. It spread rapidly and took
advantage of people that have not developed a HEALTHY SUSPICION FOR UNSOLICITED EMAILS.
Users received emails with the subject line-"I LOVE YOU" and had an attachment . Whenever, the attachment was opened, the malware
scanned the user's address book and automatically sent itself to each person on the list and install itself on the program to collect
information and passwords. 
It infected 45million computers globally and believed to have caused over $10 billion dollars in damages.
#Social Engineering: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
Ways to safeguard your organization
1. Conduct regular internal trainings e.g training on Phishing
Phishing: Use of digital communication to trick people into revealing SENSITIVE DATA or DEPLOYING malicious software.
#EQUIFAX BREACH
Equifax breach(2017): Credit reporting agency- full blown data breaches of sensitive info. Over 143million customer records were stolen
and the breach affected over 40% of Americans. PII: SSN, Birth date, Home address, credit card details.
Multiple security lapses from Equifax caused it- The attack took advantage of numerous vulnerabilities.
Equifax settled with US government to pay over $575million

Notice similar trends, patterns and methodologies, you can identify potential breach and future damage.

#C.I.S.S.P DEFINED 8 DOMAINS
Security and risk management
Asset security
Security architecture and engineering
Security operations
Software Development security
Security assessment and testing
Identity and access management
Communication and network security

#NOW
Security and risk management: Focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and 
the law. e.g update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to federal policy e.g Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)
Asset security: Focuses on securing digital and physical assets. It is related to STORAGE, MAINTENANCE, RETENTION nd DESTRUCTION OF DATA
e.g making sure that old equipment is properly disposed off and destroyed and any unused data.
Security architecture and enginerring: Focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place
e.g configure a firewall
Communication and network security: Focusues on managing and securing physical networks and wirelesss communications e.g Analysing user
behavior in your organization. e.g using usb ports to charge phones.
Identity and access management: Focuses on keeping data secure, by ensuring that users follow established policies to control and manage
physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets e.g networks and applications e.g validating the identities of employees and 
documenting access roles. Setting up employees key card access to buildings
Security assessment and testing: Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits
to monitor for risks, threats and vulnerabilities. e.g conducting regular audits of users permissions. e.g limiting access to payroll
to only certain employees.
Security operations: Conducting investigations and implementing preventatives measures. e.g receives an alert that an unidentifiable device
has been connected to your network. You will want to find the device and prevent the potential threat.
Software development security: Focuses on using secure coding practices, a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure
applications and services. e.g work with developers to ensure that security practices are incorporated into the SDLC e'g advise on password
policies or ensure that user data is properly secured and managed.

#How organization protect themselves using key principles
Frameworks
Controls
Ethics
Frameworks and Controls: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability controls- C.I.A Triage
An example of control is using security key to access your account- only a user can be able to access this even if his password is compromised
#alerts on suspicion or malicious attacks- how to protect your organization
First, identify your organization's potential risks and threats
Then, implement necessary frameworks and controls
Security frameworks- are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
It provides a structured approach in implementing a security lifecycle.
#Purpose of security frameworks
1. Protecting PII
2. Securing financial information
3. Identifying security weaknesses
4. Managing organizational risks
5. Aligning security objectives and goals

#Four Core Components of Frameworks- It will help to better manage potential risks
Goals: Identifying and documenting security goals e.g an org may want to align with EU General Data and Protection Regulation(GDPR) law
It grants European Union citizens more control over their data e.g SA may identify and document where his org is out of compliance with GDPR
Guidelines: Setting guidelines to achieve security goals e.g updating your policies to comply with GDPR policy
Communication: Implementing strong security processes
Processes: Monitoring and communicating resultse.g monitoring your org's network and report a security issue affecting GDPR to your manager.
#Security controls:
Designed to reduce specific security riskse.g an org conducting a training for its employees to complete a privacy training to reduce
the risk of data breaches. As a SA, you may use a tool to track which employee has completed the training
#C.I.A Triage
Foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risks when setting up systems and security policies.
Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access specific data or assets. e.g there should be a policy stating who shoul and should not
have access to a data should be in place.
Integrity: Means the data is correct, authentic and reliable.. use encryption to protect data integrity
Availaibility: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

NIST CSF National Institute of Standards and Technology: the Cybersecurity Framework
It consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risks
Do you know about organizational frameworks and principles?
How do you use them to secure organizations assets and infra?
Security Ethics: Are guidelines to making accurate decisions in security related issues

Ethical principles in security:
Confidentiality: Keep info like PII confidential and safe in the course of your job
Privacy: Safeguarding private information from unauthorized use.
Laws: Rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.

#Tools
SIEM tools: It collects and analyze log data to monitor critical actvities in an organization
It collects real-time log or info and allows SA to analyze it. It can provide alerts for specific types of risks and threats
e.g Splunk and Chronicle. Splunk Enterprise provides that
Playbooks: It provides details about any operational actions. It guides on how to analyze security incident before, during and after it
has occurred. 
Network protocol analyzers: Also called packet sniffer. A tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network
e.g tcpdump and wireshark
Linux operating system: Using linux to examine logs in the system. analysing error logs
