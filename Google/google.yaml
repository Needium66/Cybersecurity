#Define security- Prepare for storm- yet there are water leaks, prepare to mitigate the leaks or potential damage.
Cybersecurity (Security): Practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by protecting networks, devices,
people, and data from unathorized access or criminal exploitation. e.g
Requiring complex passwords to access sites and services to improve confidentiality against threat actors(pose danger or risk)
Benefits of security
Protects external(someone trying to gain access to private information, network or devices) or 
internal(current(accidental or accessing unathorized data) or former employee,  external vendors) threats
Maintain customers and partner trust
Maintain revenue once customers or partners trust are not lost

Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

#Evolution of attacks
Virus: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software
It attaches itself to PROGRAM or DOCUMENT on a computer. Then it spreads and INFECTS one or more computers
An example of a computer virus is a WORM-It can SPREAD and DUPLICATE on its own without human involvement
Today, viruses are commonly known as MALWARE
Malware: Software designed to harm devices or networks
Two examples of  early Malware attacks:
Brain virus
Morris worm
Brain virus(1986): Alvi brothers created it. Its intention was to TRACK illegal copies of MEDICAL SOFTWARE and prevent PIRATED LICENSES.
But it turned out unexpectedly to- when someone used a pirated software, the VIRUS infected the computer. Then any disk inserted into the
computer will also be infected. Anytime anybody used the infected disks in a new computer, the VIRUS spread. Undetected, the VIRUS spread
globally in months. It changed the security industry-e emphasizing the need for plan and productivity.
Morris worm(1988): Robert Morris developed a program to access the SIZE OF THE INTERNET. The program CRAWLED the web and installed itself
onto other computers to tally the numbers of computers that were connected to the internet. The program however failed to keep TRACK of
the computers it had already COMPROMISED and continued to REINSTALL itself, until computers RAN OUT OF MEMORY and CRASHED.
About 6000 computers were affected-this represented 10% of the INTERNET at that time. Caused millions of dollars in damages
Computer Emergency Response Teams(CERTs): were established to respond to security incidents.
Disks are no ore needed to spread virus. Internet does it through the Malware now. Malware attacks:
Loveletter Attack
Equifax breach
Loveletter Attack(Onel de Guzman): 2000- Created the loveletter malware to STEAL internet login credentials. It spread rapidly and took
advantage of people that have not developed a HEALTHY SUSPICION FOR UNSOLICITED EMAILS.
Users received emails with the subject line-"I LOVE YOU" and had an attachment . Whenever, the attachment was opened, the malware
scanned the user's address book and automatically sent itself to each person on the list and install itself on the program to collect
information and passwords. 
It infected 45million computers globally and believed to have caused over $10 billion dollars in damages.
#Social Engineering: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
Ways to safeguard your organization
1. Conduct regular internal trainings e.g training on Phishing
Phishing: Use of digital communication to trick people into revealing SENSITIVE DATA or DEPLOYING malicious software.
#EQUIFAX BREACH
Equifax breach(2017): Credit reporting agency- full blown data breaches of sensitive info. Over 143million customer records were stolen
and the breach affected over 40% of Americans. PII: SSN, Birth date, Home address, credit card details.
Multiple security lapses from Equifax caused it- The attack took advantage of numerous vulnerabilities.
Equifax settled with US government to pay over $575million

Notice similar trends, patterns and methodologies, you can identify potential breach and future damage.

#C.I.S.S.P DEFINED 8 DOMAINS
Security and risk management
Asset security
Security architecture and engineering
Security operations
Software Development security
Security assessment and testing
Identity and access management
Communication and network security

#NOW
Security and risk management: Focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and 
the law. e.g update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to federal policy e.g Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)
Asset security: Focuses on securing digital and physical assets. It is related to STORAGE, MAINTENANCE, RETENTION nd DESTRUCTION OF DATA
e.g making sure that old equipment is properly disposed off and destroyed and any unused data.
Security architecture and enginerring: Focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place
e.g configure a firewall
Communication and network security: Focusues on managing and securing physical networks and wirelesss communications e.g Analysing user
behavior in your organization. e.g using usb ports to charge phones.
Identity and access management: Focuses on keeping data secure, by ensuring that users follow established policies to control and manage
physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets e.g networks and applications e.g validating the identities of employees and 
documenting access roles. Setting up employees key card access to buildings
Security assessment and testing: Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits
to monitor for risks, threats and vulnerabilities. e.g conducting regular audits of users permissions. e.g limiting access to payroll
to only certain employees.
Security operations: Conducting investigations and implementing preventatives measures. e.g receives an alert that an unidentifiable device
has been connected to your network. You will want to find the device and prevent the potential threat.
Software development security: Focuses on using secure coding practices, a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure
applications and services. e.g work with developers to ensure that security practices are incorporated into the SDLC e'g advise on password
policies or ensure that user data is properly secured and managed.

#How organization protect themselves using key principles
Frameworks
Controls
Ethics
Frameworks and Controls: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability controls- C.I.A Triage
An example of control is using security key to access your account- only a user can be able to access this even if his password is compromised
#alerts on suspicion or malicious attacks- how to protect your organization
First, identify your organization's potential risks and threats
Then, implement necessary frameworks and controls
Security frameworks- are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
It provides a structured approach in implementing a security lifecycle.
#Purpose of security frameworks
1. Protecting PII
2. Securing financial information
3. Identifying security weaknesses
4. Managing organizational risks
5. Aligning security objectives and goals

#Four Core Components of Frameworks- It will help to better manage potential risks
Goals: Identifying and documenting security goals e.g an org may want to align with EU General Data and Protection Regulation(GDPR) law
It grants European Union citizens more control over their data e.g SA may identify and document where his org is out of compliance with GDPR
Guidelines: Setting guidelines to achieve security goals e.g updating your policies to comply with GDPR policy
Communication: Implementing strong security processes
Processes: Monitoring and communicating resultse.g monitoring your org's network and report a security issue affecting GDPR to your manager.
#Security controls:
Designed to reduce specific security riskse.g an org conducting a training for its employees to complete a privacy training to reduce
the risk of data breaches. As a SA, you may use a tool to track which employee has completed the training
#C.I.A Triage
Foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risks when setting up systems and security policies.
Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access specific data or assets. e.g there should be a policy stating who shoul and should not
have access to a data should be in place.
Integrity: Means the data is correct, authentic and reliable.. use encryption to protect data integrity
Availaibility: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

NIST CSF National Institute of Standards and Technology: the Cybersecurity Framework
It consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risks
Do you know about organizational frameworks and principles?
How do you use them to secure organizations assets and infra?
Security Ethics: Are guidelines to making accurate decisions in security related issues

Ethical principles in security:
Confidentiality: Keep info like PII confidential and safe in the course of your job
Privacy: Safeguarding private information from unauthorized use.
Laws: Rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.

#Tools
SIEM tools: It collects and analyze log data to monitor critical actvities in an organization
It collects real-time log or info and allows SA to analyze it. It can provide alerts for specific types of risks and threats
e.g Splunk and Chronicle. Splunk Enterprise provides that
Playbooks: It provides details about any operational actions. It guides on how to analyze security incident before, during and after it
has occurred. 
Network protocol analyzers: Also called packet sniffer. A tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network
e.g tcpdump and wireshark
Linux operating system: Using linux to examine logs in the system. analysing error logs
Python and SQL

Security tools

#Security  Risk and Management (Elaboration)
When you define the GOALS and OBJECTIVES, an org can reduce risks and threats to data and assets e.g PII
Risk mitigation involves the process of having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly REDUCE the impact of a risk e.g BREACH
Compliance is a method used to design an org policies and regulatory requirements and independent standards.
Business continuity is an organization's ability to MAINTAIN their productivity by establishing RISK DISASTER RECOVERY
Laws is folowing rules and ethical behavior to minimize negligence of abuse or fraud

#Asset Security
Asset security e.g PII or SPII should securely handled and protected. Whether stored in a computer, transferred over internet or physically
collected

#Security Architecture and Engineering:
Shared reepsonsibilities by all everybody in the organization. Policies can help to enable situations to be handled quickly and effectively

#Communication and Network Security
Secure networks for org data and safe communication whether on-site or in the cloud

#IAM
Reduce risks to asset and data
4 components in IAM:
Identification: Access card, biometric data e.g fingerprint, username
Authentication: Verification process to prove a person's identity e.g passowrd or pin
Authorization: Access to resources in the org based on level or title in the org.
Accountability: Monitoring and reporting user actions e.g login attempts.

#Security Assessment and Testing
New and better way to mitigate threats, risks and vulbnerabilities. Implementing a new control e.g requiring multifactor authentication

#Security operations
Work on neutralizing threats and conducting digital forensics afterwards.

#Software Development Security:
Ensure app security is implemeented.

#Threat
Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. e.g social engineering attack
Social engineeering is a manipulation technique that exploit human errors to gain private info, access and valuables. e.g phishing- technique
used to acquire sensitive data e.g username, passwords, or banking information

#Risk
Risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an asset. Low risks examples are website content,
published research data. Medium risk assests examples are  early release of a company's quarterly earnings. High risk assests examples
are SPII or PII

#Vulnerabilities
Aweakness that can be exploited by a threat
A threat and vulnerability MUST be PRESENT before there can be a RISK. e.g outdated firewall,software or application, weak passwords,
unprotected confidential data, people
#SA can help with these:
How to identify suspicious email
Moniroting and documenting employees access to critical assets

#An example of EXPENSIVE MALWARE is called RANSOMWARE
#3 impacts of threats, risks and vulnerabilities to organization.
Ransomware: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access
Once ransomware is deployed by an ATTACKER, it can FREEZE network systems, leave devices unusable and encrypt and lock confidential data
Actor demands a ransom in exchange for a decryption key.
Intranet is an example of DEEP WEB
DARKWEB: is only accessible by special software

#3 impacts of TRV
1. Financial: Once your system/network is compromised, it can lead to disruption of production and services. The COST to correct the issues
and fines for non-compliance with laws and regulations
2. Identity Theft: Storing data of employees, external data and customers for how long. Sensitive data includes PII- this can
be leaked or sold through the DARKWEB.
3. Damage to an org reputation: It could create bad press


#NIST Risk Management Framework(RMF)
There are 7 steps in RMF:
Prepare: Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs
Categorize: Used to develop risk management processes and tasks
Select: Choose, customize and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization
Implement: Implement security and privacy plan for organization
Assess: Determine if established controls are implemented correctly
Authorize: Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization
Monitor: Be aware of how systems operate

Security Frameworks: Are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. e.g social engineering attacks
and ransomware.
People are the biggest threat to security.
Security Controls: Are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
3 types of control:
Encryption
Authentication and
Authroization
Encryption: Is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. converting data from plain text
to cypher text.
Authentication: Is the process of verifyin who someone or something is. e.g login in with your username and password into a website
One of social engineering attack that can exploit authentication is vishing- the exploitation of electronic voice communication
to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
Authorization: The concept of granting access to specific resources within a system. Access a deep web only if you are a federal employee.

CIA Triad: A model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access a specific assets or data.
Integrity: The data is correct, authentic and reliable.
Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.
This is very essential for banks for example

NIST CSF- Core fucntions - IPDRR
Identify: Identify a workstation that has been compromised with an unknown device plugged into it
Protect: You block the unknown device remotely, to STOP any potential threat and PROTECT the organization. You REMOVE the workstation to prevent
the spread of the damage. The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and
tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.
Detect: You use tools to DETECT any additional threat or behavior, and identify the unknown device. Identifying potential security incidents
and improving monitoring capabilities to increase speed and efficiency of detections.
Respond: You RESPOND by investigating the incident to determine who used the unknown device, how the threat occured, what was affected and
where the attack originated. Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents and
implement improvements to the security process.
Recover: You do your best to recover any files or data that were affected. The process of returning the affected incident back to normal
operation.
NIST S.P 800-53 for Federal Government. Special Publication
Open Web Application Security Project(OWASP) security principles
1. Minimize the attack surface area- disabling software features, control who can access certain assets, or establish more complex password
requirements
2. Principles of least privilege-least amount of access given to users to perform their tasks.
3. Defense in depth- Have more security controls that deals with risks and threats in different ways. e.g Using MFA
4. Seperation of duties- no one should be giving so many privileges so that they can misuse the system. e.g person who signs paycheck
should not be the one preparing them.
5. Keep security simple-don't make security control complex.
6. Fix security issues correctly-weak password to access an organization's wifi.

#Security audit
It is a review of an organization's security controls, policies and procedures against a set of expectations.
There are 2 types of security audits- external and internal
Internal Security Audity team- Compliance officer, security manager and other security team members.
Purpose of internal security audits
1. To improve an org security posture.
2. To avoid paying fines to regulatory bodies due to non-compliance
3. Identify organizational risks
4. Access controls
5. Correct compliance issues

#Common elements of internal audits
1. Establishing the scope and goals
2. Conducting a risk assessment of the organization's assets- often consucted by managers or other stakeholders
3. Completing a controls assessment
4. Assessment compliance- e.g compliance with GDPR if you run your business in the EU
5. Communicating results

Scope could be:
Assess users permissions
Identify existing controls, policies and procedures
Account for technology currently in use

Goals could be:
Adhere to the NIST CSF
Fortify system controls
Establish policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations

#Audit questions will help you to answer the remaining 3 common elements
What is the audit meant to achieve?
Which assets are most at risk?
Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?
What controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?

#Controls division
Administrative e.g passowrd policies
Technicale.g intrusion detection systems, encryption
Physical e.g surveilance camera, locks

#Stakeholder communication
Summarizes scope and goals
List existing risks
Notes how quickly those risks needs to be addressed
Identifies compliance regulations
Provides recommendations

#Common logs that you will need to be analyzing
Firewall logs: a record of established or attempted connections for incoming traffic from the internet. It also includes outbound requests
to the internet from within the network
Network logs: a record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. It also records connections between devices and
services on the network.
Server logs: a record of events related to services, e.g websites, emails, or file shares . It includes actions e.g login, passowrd
and username requests

SIEM provides:
real time visibility
event monitoring
automated alerts
stores all data in a centralized location (index)

#Different types of SIEM tools
Self hosted: an org will install,operate and maintain. bank can use this e.g Splunk Enterprise
Cloud based: maintain and manage by SIEM providers. e.g Splunk Cloud, Chronicle
Hybrid hosted: combine two- to leverage of the cloud and maintain physical assets to the tool

#Playbook
A manual that provides details about any operational action. Different types of playbooks e.g for incident response, security alerts,
team specific and product specific playbook, malware, ransomware, DDOS etc
Commonly used playbook- Incident response playbook: It is a guide with 6 phases used to mitigate and manage security incidents from
beginning to the end.
1. Preparation: Org must prepare to mitigate risks, by documenting procedures, establish plans and educate users.
2. Detection and analysis: Define and analyse events, using defined processes and technology.
3. Containment: Prevent further damage and reduce immediate impact of security incidents.
4. Eradication and recovery: Remove artifcats so that the org can return to normal operations. Also known as IT restoration
5. Post incident activity: documenting the incidents
6. Coordination: Recording and reporting the incidents throughout the incidents response period.

Playbook for malware:
assess the alert- determine if the alert is valid or not by analyzing the logs in SIEM
actions and tools to use to reduce the damage of the malware e.g ISOLATE OR DISCONNECT THE INFECTED NETWORK SYSTEM
eliminate the traces of the incident and restore the affected the systems back to normal operations- e.g restore the affected OS, then
restore the affected data using a cleanup created.
perform post incident actvities: creating final report to report to stakeholders or to necessary authorities
