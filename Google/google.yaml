#Define security- Prepare for storm- yet there are water leaks, prepare to mitigate the leaks or potential damage.
Cybersecurity (Security): Practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of information by protecting networks, devices,
people, and data from unathorized access or criminal exploitation. e.g
Requiring complex passwords to access sites and services to improve confidentiality against threat actors(pose danger or risk)
Benefits of security
Protects external(someone trying to gain access to private information, network or devices) or 
internal(current(accidental or accessing unathorized data) or former employee,  external vendors) threats
Maintain customers and partner trust
Maintain revenue once customers or partners trust are not lost

Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

#Roles
1. Security analyst or specialist- Monitoring and protecting information and system
#3 responsibilites of security analyst
Protecting and monitoring computer and network systems (contribute to pen testing or ethical hacking). Proactively work to prevent risks
Install Software and hardware for development
Conducting periodic audits (confidential information is secure)
2. Cybersecurity analyst or specialist
#Responsibilities
Security operations center (SOC) analyst
Information security analyst

#Evolution of attacks
Virus: Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software
It attaches itself to PROGRAM or DOCUMENT on a computer. Then it spreads and INFECTS one or more computers
An example of a computer virus is a WORM-It can SPREAD and DUPLICATE on its own without human involvement
Today, viruses are commonly known as MALWARE
Malware: Software designed to harm devices or networks
Two examples of  early Malware attacks:
Brain virus
Morris worm
Brain virus(1986): Alvi brothers created it. Its intention was to TRACK illegal copies of MEDICAL SOFTWARE and prevent PIRATED LICENSES.
But it turned out unexpectedly to- when someone used a pirated software, the VIRUS infected the computer. Then any disk inserted into the
computer will also be infected. Anytime anybody used the infected disks in a new computer, the VIRUS spread. Undetected, the VIRUS spread
globally in months. It changed the security industry-e emphasizing the need for plan and productivity.
Morris worm(1988): Robert Morris developed a program to access the SIZE OF THE INTERNET. The program CRAWLED the web and installed itself
onto other computers to tally the numbers of computers that were connected to the internet. The program however failed to keep TRACK of
the computers it had already COMPROMISED and continued to REINSTALL itself, until computers RAN OUT OF MEMORY and CRASHED.
About 6000 computers were affected-this represented 10% of the INTERNET at that time. Caused millions of dollars in damages
Computer Emergency Response Teams(CERTs): were established to respond to security incidents.
Disks are no ore needed to spread virus. Internet does it through the Malware now. Malware attacks:
Loveletter Attack
Equifax breach
Loveletter Attack(Onel de Guzman): 2000- Created the loveletter malware to STEAL internet login credentials. It spread rapidly and took
advantage of people that have not developed a HEALTHY SUSPICION FOR UNSOLICITED EMAILS.
Users received emails with the subject line-"I LOVE YOU" and had an attachment . Whenever, the attachment was opened, the malware
scanned the user's address book and automatically sent itself to each person on the list and install itself on the program to collect
information and passwords. 
It infected 45million computers globally and believed to have caused over $10 billion dollars in damages.
#Social Engineering: A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
Ways to safeguard your organization
1. Conduct regular internal trainings e.g training on Phishing
Phishing: Use of digital communication to trick people into revealing SENSITIVE DATA or DEPLOYING malicious software.
#EQUIFAX BREACH
Equifax breach(2017): Credit reporting agency- full blown data breaches of sensitive info. Over 143million customer records were stolen
and the breach affected over 40% of Americans. PII: SSN, Birth date, Home address, credit card details.
Multiple security lapses from Equifax caused it- The attack took advantage of numerous vulnerabilities.
Equifax settled with US government to pay over $575million

Notice similar trends, patterns and methodologies, you can identify potential breach and future damage.

#C.I.S.S.P DEFINED 8 DOMAINS
Security and risk management
Asset security
Security architecture and engineering
Security operations
Software Development security
Security assessment and testing
Identity and access management
Communication and network security

#NOW
Security and risk management: Focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and 
the law. e.g update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to federal policy e.g Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)
Asset security: Focuses on securing digital and physical assets. It is related to STORAGE, MAINTENANCE, RETENTION nd DESTRUCTION OF DATA
e.g making sure that old equipment is properly disposed off and destroyed and any unused data.
Security architecture and enginerring: Focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place
e.g configure a firewall
Communication and network security: Focusues on managing and securing physical networks and wirelesss communications e.g Analysing user
behavior in your organization. e.g using usb ports to charge phones.
Identity and access management: Focuses on keeping data secure, by ensuring that users follow established policies to control and manage
physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets e.g networks and applications e.g validating the identities of employees and 
documenting access roles. Setting up employees key card access to buildings
Security assessment and testing: Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits
to monitor for risks, threats and vulnerabilities. e.g conducting regular audits of users permissions. e.g limiting access to payroll
to only certain employees.
Security operations: Conducting investigations and implementing preventatives measures. e.g receives an alert that an unidentifiable device
has been connected to your network. You will want to find the device and prevent the potential threat.
Software development security: Focuses on using secure coding practices, a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure
applications and services. e.g work with developers to ensure that security practices are incorporated into the SDLC e'g advise on password
policies or ensure that user data is properly secured and managed.

#How organization protect themselves using key principles
Frameworks
Controls
Ethics
Frameworks and Controls: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability controls- C.I.A Triage
An example of control is using security key to access your account- only a user can be able to access this even if his password is compromised
#alerts on suspicion or malicious attacks- how to protect your organization
First, identify your organization's potential risks and threats
Then, implement necessary frameworks and controls
Security frameworks- are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
It provides a structured approach in implementing a security lifecycle.
#Purpose of security frameworks
1. Protecting PII
2. Securing financial information
3. Identifying security weaknesses
4. Managing organizational risks
5. Aligning security objectives and goals

#Four Core Components of Frameworks- It will help to better manage potential risks
Goals: Identifying and documenting security goals e.g an org may want to align with EU General Data and Protection Regulation(GDPR) law
It grants European Union citizens more control over their data e.g SA may identify and document where his org is out of compliance with GDPR
Guidelines: Setting guidelines to achieve security goals e.g updating your policies to comply with GDPR policy
Communication: Implementing strong security processes
Processes: Monitoring and communicating resultse.g monitoring your org's network and report a security issue affecting GDPR to your manager.
#Security controls:
Designed to reduce specific security riskse.g an org conducting a training for its employees to complete a privacy training to reduce
the risk of data breaches. As a SA, you may use a tool to track which employee has completed the training
#C.I.A Triage
Foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risks when setting up systems and security policies.
Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access specific data or assets. e.g there should be a policy stating who shoul and should not
have access to a data should be in place.
Integrity: Means the data is correct, authentic and reliable.. use encryption to protect data integrity
Availaibility: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

NIST CSF National Institute of Standards and Technology: the Cybersecurity Framework
It consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risks
Do you know about organizational frameworks and principles?
How do you use them to secure organizations assets and infra?
Security Ethics: Are guidelines to making accurate decisions in security related issues

Ethical principles in security:
Confidentiality: Keep info like PII confidential and safe in the course of your job
Privacy: Safeguarding private information from unauthorized use.
Laws: Rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.

#Tools
SIEM tools: It collects and analyze log data to monitor critical actvities in an organization
It collects real-time log or info and allows SA to analyze it. It can provide alerts for specific types of risks and threats
e.g Splunk and Chronicle. Splunk Enterprise provides that
Playbooks: It provides details about any operational actions. It guides on how to analyze security incident before, during and after it
has occurred. 
Network protocol analyzers: Also called packet sniffer. A tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network
e.g tcpdump and wireshark
Linux operating system: Using linux to examine logs in the system. analysing error logs
Python and SQL


#2. How to Manage Security Risks and Threats
Identity Risks and Threats in Cybersecurity
Certified Information Security Professional (CISSP) Eight Domains
Security Frameworks and controls
Security audits
Security tools

#Security  Risk and Management (Elaboration)
When you define the GOALS and OBJECTIVES, an org can reduce risks and threats to data and assets e.g PII
Risk mitigation involves the process of having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly REDUCE the impact of a risk e.g BREACH
Compliance is a method used to design an org policies and regulatory requirements and independent standards.
Business continuity is an organization's ability to MAINTAIN their productivity by establishing RISK DISASTER RECOVERY
Laws is folowing rules and ethical behavior to minimize negligence of abuse or fraud

#Asset Security
Asset security e.g PII or SPII should securely handled and protected. Whether stored in a computer, transferred over internet or physically
collected

#Security Architecture and Engineering:
Shared reepsonsibilities by all everybody in the organization. Policies can help to enable situations to be handled quickly and effectively

#Communication and Network Security
Secure networks for org data and safe communication whether on-site or in the cloud

#IAM
Reduce risks to asset and data
4 components in IAM:
Identification: Access card, biometric data e.g fingerprint, username
Authentication: Verification process to prove a person's identity e.g passowrd or pin
Authorization: Access to resources in the org based on level or title in the org.
Accountability: Monitoring and reporting user actions e.g login attempts.

#Security Assessment and Testing
New and better way to mitigate threats, risks and vulbnerabilities. Implementing a new control e.g requiring multifactor authentication

#Security operations
Work on neutralizing threats and conducting digital forensics afterwards.

#Software Development Security:
Ensure app security is implemeented.

#Threat
Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. e.g social engineering attack
Social engineeering is a manipulation technique that exploit human errors to gain private info, access and valuables. e.g phishing- technique
used to acquire sensitive data e.g username, passwords, or banking information

#Risk
Risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an asset. Low risks examples are website content,
published research data. Medium risk assests examples are  early release of a company's quarterly earnings. High risk assests examples
are SPII or PII

#Vulnerabilities
Aweakness that can be exploited by a threat
A threat and vulnerability MUST be PRESENT before there can be a RISK. e.g outdated firewall,software or application, weak passwords,
unprotected confidential data, people
#SA can help with these:
How to identify suspicious email
Moniroting and documenting employees access to critical assets

#An example of EXPENSIVE MALWARE is called RANSOMWARE
#3 impacts of threats, risks and vulnerabilities to organization.
Ransomware: A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access
Once ransomware is deployed by an ATTACKER, it can FREEZE network systems, leave devices unusable and encrypt and lock confidential data
Actor demands a ransom in exchange for a decryption key.
Intranet is an example of DEEP WEB
DARKWEB: is only accessible by special software

#3 impacts of TRV
1. Financial: Once your system/network is compromised, it can lead to disruption of production and services. The COST to correct the issues
and fines for non-compliance with laws and regulations
2. Identity Theft: Storing data of employees, external data and customers for how long. Sensitive data includes PII- this can
be leaked or sold through the DARKWEB.
3. Damage to an org reputation: It could create bad press


#NIST Risk Management Framework(RMF)
There are 7 steps in RMF:
Prepare: Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs
Categorize: Used to develop risk management processes and tasks
Select: Choose, customize and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization
Implement: Implement security and privacy plan for organization
Assess: Determine if established controls are implemented correctly
Authorize: Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization
Monitor: Be aware of how systems operate

Security Frameworks: Are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. e.g social engineering attacks
and ransomware.
People are the biggest threat to security.
Security Controls: Are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.
3 types of control:
Encryption
Authentication and
Authroization
Encryption: Is the process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format. converting data from plain text
to cypher text.
Authentication: Is the process of verifyin who someone or something is. e.g login in with your username and password into a website
One of social engineering attack that can exploit authentication is vishing- the exploitation of electronic voice communication
to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
Authorization: The concept of granting access to specific resources within a system. Access a deep web only if you are a federal employee.

CIA Triad: A model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access a specific assets or data.
Integrity: The data is correct, authentic and reliable.
Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.
This is very essential for banks for example

NIST CSF- Core fucntions - IPDRR
Identify: Identify a workstation that has been compromised with an unknown device plugged into it
Protect: You block the unknown device remotely, to STOP any potential threat and PROTECT the organization. You REMOVE the workstation to prevent
the spread of the damage. The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and
tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.
Detect: You use tools to DETECT any additional threat or behavior, and identify the unknown device. Identifying potential security incidents
and improving monitoring capabilities to increase speed and efficiency of detections.
Respond: You RESPOND by investigating the incident to determine who used the unknown device, how the threat occured, what was affected and
where the attack originated. Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents and
implement improvements to the security process.
Recover: You do your best to recover any files or data that were affected. The process of returning the affected incident back to normal
operation.
NIST S.P 800-53 for Federal Government. Special Publication
Open Web Application Security Project(OWASP) security principles
1. Minimize the attack surface area- disabling software features, control who can access certain assets, or establish more complex password
requirements
2. Principles of least privilege-least amount of access given to users to perform their tasks.
3. Defense in depth- Have more security controls that deals with risks and threats in different ways. e.g Using MFA
4. Seperation of duties- no one should be giving so many privileges so that they can misuse the system. e.g person who signs paycheck
should not be the one preparing them.
5. Keep security simple-don't make security control complex.
6. Fix security issues correctly-weak password to access an organization's wifi.

#Security audit
It is a review of an organization's security controls, policies and procedures against a set of expectations.
There are 2 types of security audits- external and internal
Internal Security Audity team- Compliance officer, security manager and other security team members.
Purpose of internal security audits
1. To improve an org security posture.
2. To avoid paying fines to regulatory bodies due to non-compliance
3. Identify organizational risks
4. Access controls
5. Correct compliance issues

#Common elements of internal audits
1. Establishing the scope and goals
2. Conducting a risk assessment of the organization's assets- often consucted by managers or other stakeholders
3. Completing a controls assessment
4. Assessment compliance- e.g compliance with GDPR if you run your business in the EU
5. Communicating results

Scope could be:
Assess users permissions
Identify existing controls, policies and procedures
Account for technology currently in use

Goals could be:
Adhere to the NIST CSF
Fortify system controls
Establish policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulations

#Audit questions will help you to answer the remaining 3 common elements
What is the audit meant to achieve?
Which assets are most at risk?
Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?
What controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?

#Controls division
Administrative e.g passowrd policies
Technicale.g intrusion detection systems, encryption
Physical e.g surveilance camera, locks

#Stakeholder communication
Summarizes scope and goals
List existing risks
Notes how quickly those risks needs to be addressed
Identifies compliance regulations
Provides recommendations

#Common logs that you will need to be analyzing
Firewall logs: a record of established or attempted connections for incoming traffic from the internet. It also includes outbound requests
to the internet from within the network
Network logs: a record of all computers and devices that enter and leave the network. It also records connections between devices and
services on the network.
Server logs: a record of events related to services, e.g websites, emails, or file shares . It includes actions e.g login, passowrd
and username requests

SIEM provides:
real time visibility
event monitoring
automated alerts
stores all data in a centralized location (index)

#Different types of SIEM tools
Self hosted: an org will install,operate and maintain. bank can use this e.g Splunk Enterprise
Cloud based: maintain and manage by SIEM providers. e.g Splunk Cloud, Chronicle
Hybrid hosted: combine two- to leverage of the cloud and maintain physical assets to the tool

#Playbook
A manual that provides details about any operational action. Different types of playbooks e.g for incident response, security alerts,
team specific and product specific playbook, malware, ransomware, DDOS etc
Commonly used playbook- Incident response playbook: It is a guide with 6 phases used to mitigate and manage security incidents from
beginning to the end.
1. Preparation: Org must prepare to mitigate risks, by documenting procedures, establish plans and educate users.
2. Detection and analysis: Define and analyse events, using defined processes and technology.
3. Containment: Prevent further damage and reduce immediate impact of security incidents.
4. Eradication and recovery: Remove artifcats so that the org can return to normal operations. Also known as IT restoration
5. Post incident activity: documenting the incidents
6. Coordination: Recording and reporting the incidents throughout the incidents response period.

Playbook for malware:
assess the alert- determine if the alert is valid or not by analyzing the logs in SIEM
actions and tools to use to reduce the damage of the malware e.g ISOLATE OR DISCONNECT THE INFECTED NETWORK SYSTEM
eliminate the traces of the incident and restore the affected the systems back to normal operations- e.g restore the affected OS, then
restore the affected data using a cleanup created.
perform post incident actvities: creating final report to report to stakeholders or to necessary authorities

#INTERNET NETWORKS AND NETWORK SECURITY
Stucture of network
Network operations
Network attacks
Security hardening

#Structure of a network
Structure of a network
Standard networking tools
Cloud networks
TCP/IP model

#Structure of a network
The IPs and MAC addresses will enable devices to communicate with each other. Devices can communicate on two types of network- Local
Area Network(LAN)-spans a small area e.g office building, a school, or a home ( e.g a phone+wifi=LAN) and Wide Area Network(WAN)- spans
on large geographical area e.g city, state or country e.g internet (an employee in SanFras+ an employee in Dublin)
#Common devices that make up a networking tools (These 4 are all physical tools)
Hub: a network device that broadcast info to every device on the network.
Switch: it makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them. More intelligent than hub.
It only passes data to the intended destination. More secure than hub
Router: It is device that connects multiple networks to one and another. e.g passing info from one computer to a tablet.
It leaves the computer and goes to the router, which finds the network address and forwards the data to the intended router and finally
the receiving router directs the info to the tablet
Modem: A device that connects your router to the internet and brings internet access to LAN. computer sending info from one location to
a computer in another location- computer to a router, through a modem, to the internet. to the reciving router, and then to the computer
#Virtualization tools: 
Pieces of software that performs network operations. They replace the physical tools and provided by cloud service providers
AWS Transit Gateway is used a network hub in AWS
A data packet will have a Header e.g IP address, Body e.g MAC(Media Address Control) address and Footer e.g Protocol number i.e HEADER+BODY+FOOTER
#TCP/IP Model
TCP is an internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.
Internet Protocol(IP): A set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on a network.
IPs that are sent across networks are assigned ports(ithey organize the sending and receiving of data across networks)
Common ports:
Port 25- Email
Port 443- Secure internet connection
Layers of TCP/IP Models(4): NITA . 
Network access layer: Layer 1- creation of data packets and transmission across network e.g hardware devices connected to physical cables
and switches that directs data to its destination
Internet layer: Layer 2- it is where IP addresses are attached to data packets to indicate location of the sender or receiver. It determines
whether data will be sent to e.g LAN or remote network for example.
Transport layer:  It controls the flow of the traffic across a network
Application layer: It determines how the data packets will interact receiving devcies e.g file transmers, email.

#Network Protocols
A set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure of the data. e.g
User hits a website for something, TCP handsake will help to enable the communication between the user and remote server to get a response
from. The server will send out data packets that will be viewable by the user on the webpage.
HTTPS: Allows web browser to send data securely over a network.
Domain Name System(DNS): Trannslates the internet domain names e.g yummy.com to IP addresses
Finally: Just by sending a request, it will do TCP, ARP, HTTPS and DNS

Security Protocols:
HTTPS
TLS/SSL

Firewall: A network security device that monitors traffic to and from your network It either allows or blocks network. A firewall can use port filtering- 
that allows or blocks certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication.
Hardware firewall:
Software Firewall: Performs the same function. It is a software program installed on a server or computer.
Stateful firewall: It keeps  track of info passing through it and proactively filters out threats.
Stateless firewall: It operates based on defined rules and does not keep track of info from data packets. They considered less secure
than stateful firewall.
Next Genration Firewalls: Provides even more security than stateful firewall. It not only performs tracking of incoming and outgoing
traffic, it also performs more in-depth security functions e.g intrusion detection, deep packet inspection, threat intelligence.

#VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK(VPN)
A network security service changes your public IP address and hides your virtual location so that you can keep your data private when
you are using a public network like internet. It also encrypts your data and travels the internet to preserve confidentiality. It also
performs encapsulation- a process performed by a vpn service that protects your data by wrapping sensitive data in other data packets.
Basically VPN encrypts your data and encapsulate them in other data packets.
Security zone: A segment of network that protects the internal network from the internet. Part of security network called network segmentation
An example of network segmentation is hotel that offers free wi-fi.
An organization NETWORK can be sub divided into SUBNETWORKS OR SUBNET (Like segmenting them due to security; when an attack occurs in one subnet
it will not affect the other network)- it maintains privacy for each department in an organization. Database subnet, Weserver subnet,
Web reporting subnet. If there is an attack on the database subnet, an admin can isolate it and tackle it.
Classification of security zones: 2
Uncontrolled zone: Any network outside of the organizations control. e.g internet. 
Controlled zone: A subnet that protects the internal network from uncontrolled zone. TYPES OF CONTROLLED ZONE-
Demilitarized zone(DMZ)-It is in the outer layer. It contains public-facing services that can access the internet. e.g web servers,
proxy servers that hosts websites for the public, DNS servers that provide IP address for internet users., email and file servers
that handles communication.
Internal network- contains private servers and data that the organization needs to protect
Restricted zone- Protects highly confidential info. It is always accessible to employees with certain privileges.
DMZ is situated between two firewalls. One filters traffic outside the DMZ and the other one filters traffic entering the internal
network. it protects the internal network against external attack. There is a restricted zone protected by another firewall, so that
any attack that enters the DMZ zone CANNOT spread to the restricted zone or penetrate the internal network.

INTERNET -- FIREWALL == (DMZ) == FIREWALL -- (INTERNAL NETWORK == FIREWALL == RESTRICTED ZONE)
For the DMZ, the policies that you can implement include:
Restrict ports and IPs
Only HTTPS traffic can access your DMZ

How to secure INTERNAL NETWORKS: with PROXY SERVERS (Very important to protect against attacks)
Proxy servers are another system that helps secure networks. It is a server that fulfils requests of a client by forwarding them on to
other servers. It is a dedicated SERVER that is between the INTERNET and the rest of the networks. It uses a public IP address that is
different from all the private network. It hides the private IP address from malicious act from the internet and adds a layer of security.
It can also be used to block websites that you don't want anybody from your organization to have access to. It uses temporary memory.
Types of proxy service:
1) Forward proxy server- regualtes and restrict's access to the internet. Goal is to hide IP address and approve all outgoing requests.
2) Reverse Proxy Server-regulates and restricts internet access to an internal server. Goal is to accept traffic from external service, approves it
and forward it to internal server. Used for protecting web servers with confidential info.
3) Email proxy server- it filter's spam email by verifying whether a sender's address is forged, It reduces phishing for example.
Why do I need to secure networks?
Common network intrusion attacks:
Malware
Spoofing: It is another type of network attack, when an attacker changes the SOURCE IP of a data packet to impersonate an authorized user
and gain access to a network. Hackers pretend to be what they are not so that can communicate over the network with the target Some common
IP sppofing attacks are-
On-path attack: An attacker will place himself or herself in the middle of an authrorized connections and alters or intercepts data in transit.
e.g the attacker gains access and put himself between two devices (web server and web browser). Then, they sniff the packet info and learn
about the IP and MAC addresses of the two devices.
Replay attack: A network performed when a malicious actor INTERCEPTS a data packet in transit and DELAYS IT or REPEAT IT another time.
Smurf attack: A network attack performed when an attacker SNIFFS an AUTHORIZED USER'S IP ADRESS and FLOOD it with PACKETS. It is combination
of DDoS attack and IP spoofing to bring down the servers and the entire network.
How to protect your network from packet spoofing attack:
Implement encryption of data always
Configure firewalls
Network segmentation
Use only current wireless connection
Packet sniffing: Using of software tools to observe data as it moves across network. Personnally, you can legally use PACKET SNIFFING to
analyze and capture packets when investigating ongoing incidents or debugging network issues. Stand in between 2 authorized users to gain
control of the network. Packet sniffing can be active or passive. Passive sniffing is a type of attack where DATA PACKETS are read IN TRANSIT.
Packet flooding. Active packet sniffing is a type of attack where data packets are manipulated in traffic e.g injecting IP to redirect
packets to unintended port or changing the info the packets contain. How to protect MALICIOUS PACKET SNIFFING ATTACK:
1. VPN Tunneling- Using VPN to protect and encrypt the data as it travels across the internet. When you use VPN hackers may interfere with
your network, but they will not be able to DECODE or READ YOUR PRIVATE INFO.
2. Using HTTPS at the beginning of your domain. Using SSL/TLS at the beginning of your communication.
3. Using unprotected wi-fi- e.g at coffee shops or restaurants or airports. Avoid using free wifi, unless you have VPN installed.

What can result from an attack on an organization:
Leaking of valuable or confidential information
Damaging an organization's reputation
Impacting customer retention
Costing money and time
Examples:
An attack on Home Depot in 2014- Hackers compromised Home Depot's servers with Malware. By the time network admin shut down the attack.
Attackers had already taking debit and credit info of customers-56 million customers.
Common network attacks to be protected from:
Denial of Service Attack(DoS)- an attack that targets a NETWORK or SERVER and floods it with NETWORK TRAFFIC. The goal is to OVERLOAD
an organization's network in order to disrupt its operations.Send so much info/traffic to a network device, in order to CRASH IT OR MAKE IT
UNABLE TO RESPOND to legitimate users. A network crash can also lead them to more VULNERABILITIES and THREATS apart from MONEY and TIME
that will be lost.
Distributed Denial of Service Attack(DDOS)- It is DOS attack that uses MULTIPLE DEVICES or SERVERS in different locations to flood the target
network with unwanted traffic
A good example of DOS attack: an attacker crafted a CAREFUL PACKET that caused a router to spend more time processing the request. There is
a specific and never ending situation
3 COMMON LEVELS DOS ATTACKS:
1. SYN Flood Attack- It is a type of DOS attack that SIMULATES A TCP connection and FLOODS a server with a SYN packets. This is targeted at
Handsake SYN-SYN-ACK-ACK process. So the goal is to flood the first step with SYN packets or requests that will overwhelm the ports on the
server and prevent it from able to handle the request, thereby the server getting overwhelmed.
2. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)- An internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors
across the network. ICMP Flood Attack: It is a type of DoS attack where an attacker repeatedly sends ICMP packets to a network server. This
will FORCE a server to send an ICMP back. This eventually USES all the BANDWIDTH for incoming and outgoing traffic and causing the server
to crash
Both ICMP and SYN Flood Attacks take advantage of COMMUNICATION REQUESTS to achieve their goals. The 3rd one does damage with just ONE REQUEST
3. Ping of Death- It is a type of DOS attack where an attacker PINGS A SYSTEM by sending it an OVERSIZED ICMP packet that is beigger than 64KB.
Since a correctly sized ICMP packet is 64Kilobytes. An hacker sends more than appropriate size in order to overwhelm the network.

#Security Hardening
#OS Hardening
#Network Hardening Practices
#Cloud Network Hardening

#Security Hardening
Security hardening is implemented for:
Devices
Networks
Applications
Cloud infrastructure
Part of job responsibilities of an SA are- patch updates and backups.
Security hardening is the process of STRENGHTENING a system to REDUCE vulnerabilities and attack surface- all the potential vulnerabilities
that a threat actor could exploit. An SA will perform regular maintenance to enable network device and systems functioning securely.
Security hardening can be conducted on Hardware, Applications, Databases, Devices and Networks. Examples of security hardening- software
patches, configuration changes e.g regular password change, removing or disabling unused apps and services, disabling unused ports, condcuting
regular penetration testing- helps to identify VULNERABILITIES in SYSTEMS, NETWORKS, WEBSITES, APPLICATIONS and PROCESSES.

#OS HARDENING
To strengthen an OS, you can do:
Regular updates e.g patch installation(patch updates), baseline configuration, hardware and software disposal
Backups
Keeping an up-to-date list of devices and authroized users.
Password regular change, MFA etc.

#NETWORK SECURITY HARDENING
It strenghtens networks such as:
Port filtering: This is performed regularly. It is a firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit
unwanted communication. Basic principle is to ONLY ALLOW ports that are being used for network operations.
Network access privilege: Performed regularly. Set up networks with up-to-date firewall protocols. Using network segmentation to isolate
according to departments.
Encryption of networks: Performed regularly. Encrypt all data using current standard encryption.
Some network hardening tasks that are performed once are:
- firewall rules maintenance
- Network log analysis- examine network logs to IDENTIFY EVENTS of INTERESTS. There is where SIEM is used SIEM presents logs
on the scale of PRIORITY- HIGH to LOW. High priorities logs have a short time frame for mitigation.
- Patch updates
- Server backups

#CLOUD NETWORK HARDENING
Separation of data- older apps should be kept sperate from newer apps.
Backend apps should be separate from Frontend apps

#CYBERSECURITY ASSETS, NETWORK THREATS AND VULNERABILITIES
Asset Security
Security systems and controls
Common vulnerabilities in the systems

Risk: Anything that can affect the integrity, confidentiality or availability of an asset. CIA
Security planning- first step of CIA triad.
Security Risk Planning: Are based on 3 elements-
Assets
Threats and
Vulnerabilities
They measure these to know how they can impact CIA. Each of them is WHY, WHAT and HOW OF SECURITY
Asset: An item of value for an organization. e.g building, data, people, businesses. Security teams can PRIORITIZE their ASSETS based
on threats.
Threat: An circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
Vulnerabilities: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat. Vulnerabilities are FLAWS within an ASSET. Asset can have many TYPES of
VULNERABILITIES.
You can only protect things that you account for.
Asset Management: The process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them.
All security plan revolves around Asset management.
You need to be able to rate your assets-
Asset classification: The practice of labelling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization. Bais that most companies 
follow to classify their assets include- PUBLIC, INTERNAL ONLY, CONFIDENTIAL and RESTRICTED.
Public- can be shared with anyone
Internal-only- can be shared ONLY with people int the organization.
Confidential- can only be shared by people working only a specific project.\
RESTRICTED- HIGHLY SENSITIVE AND NEED TO BE PROTECTED e.g IP, FINANCIAL INFO ETC.

Security teams PROTECT data in 3 different STATE:
In-use- it is being used by one or 2 people e.g when you log in
In-transit- data traveling from one place to another
At rest- data not currently being used. data that has been stored

INFORMATION SECURITY(INFOSEC): Keeping data at all states away from an unauthorized user. Weak infosec can lead to
1. Identity theft
2. Reputation damage
3. Financial loss
Types of risk categories:
Damage
Disclosure
Loss of information

Elements of SECURITY PLAN: It consists of 3 elements
Policies
Standards
Procedures
#Policies
A policy is a set of rules that REDUCES risk or PROTECT information. It identifies the scope, objectives and purpose of a security plan.
e.g New hieres sign Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
#sTANDARDS
Tactical part of security planning. References that inform how to set policies. e.g companies using password management standard identified
in special publication, 800-63B
#Procedures
Step-by-step instructions to perform a specific security task. e.g how employees can securely reset a password when it has been Locked.

#Compliance - It comes after security planning
Compliance:
It is the process of ADHERING to internal STANDARDS and EXTERNAL REGULATIONS. Maintaining trust, reputation, safety and integrity are what 
are important for COMPLIANCE. fines, lawsuit and regulations are what make compliance important.
Focus of our compliance will be based on NIST-CSF:
One of the roles of NIST is to openly provide organization with set of frameworksand security standards that REFLECT key security regulations
Components of NIST-CSF are 3:
Core- simplified version of FUNCTIONS, or DUTIES, of a security plan. It identifies 5 broad functions of NIST-CSF
1. Identify(asset management related), Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover (IPDRR)
Tiers- It provides security teams a way to MEASURE performance of each of the 5 fucntions of Core. From levels 1 -5. Level 1 means it is
PASSIVE and Level 4 means it is ADAPTIVE.
Profiles: Final components of CSF. It provides INSIGHT into the CURRENT STATE of a security plan.

#IMPORTANT: Keep CURRENT or ABREAST with BEST PRACTICES and EMERGING TRENDS.

#SECURITY CONTROLS
Security controls: Are SAFEGUARDS designed to REDUCE specific security risks.
Types of security controls- 3 types:
1. Technical- many technologies to protect assets e.g encryptions, authentication systems and others.
2. Operational- it involves day-to-day handling of security environment e.g awareness training, incident response.
3. Managerial- Centred around how the first 2 REDUCE risks. e.g polices, standards and procedures.
Security controls are technologies used to REGULATE information privacy.
Encryption: Genesis- Ceasar's Cipher from Julius Ceasar. Cipher is an algorithm that encrypts information.
Cryptographic key-is a mechanism that DECRYPTS ciphertext
Flaws of cipher:
Brute Force Attack- A trial and error processes of discovering private information.
It relies on single key.
We use Public Key Infrastructure( PKI) now:
An encryption framework that SECURES exchange of information online. How it works- 2 step process
1. Starts with exchange of encrypted information- asymmetric encryption, symmetric encryption or both
Asymmetric encryption: Involves use of a public and private key pair for encryption and decryption of data. public key can be used by
any reource, server or anybody to have access to data it is encrypting, private key is only accessible to the user or resource to decrypt
whatever data that is encrypted. It slows down process
Symmetric encryption: The use of SINGLE secret key to exchange information. It is a faster process.
2. Establish trust using a system of digital certifcates.

Hash function: An algorithm that PRODUCES a code that can't be DECRYPTED. It is a one-way key unlike asymmetric and symmetric encryption.
It produces unique identifier instead. Find the hash values of files or applications and comparing them against known malicious files.
e,g hashing a file - "sha256sum newfile.txt"
VirusTotal: Tool used by SA to analyze suspicious files, domains, IPs and URLs.
Non-repudiation: The concept that the authenticity of information CANNOT be denied.

#ACCESS CONTROLS
Security controls that manage access, authorization, and accountability of information.
AAA Framework
Authentication- to answer- who are you? question. 3 factors of authentication-
knowledge- something the user knows e.g security question
Ownership- something the user possesses e.g OTP
Characteristics- something the user is e.g fingerprints, biometrics etc.
SSO is great because it eases the problem of having to be authenticated severally, but it is not too good when using a single sign in
Use MFA instead to make it more secure.
Authorization- Related to separation of duties and action of least privilege. e.g HTTP Basic Auth- HTTP uses basic auth-technology used
to establish a user's request to a server. Flaw- it transfers username and password openly through the network. People use HTTPS
these days. and OAuth- Open standard authorization protocol that shares designated access between applications. It uses API token.
Accountability- monitoring the access logs of a system- who access the system, when do they access the system, what resources do they
access? e.f failed log in attempt #ACCESS LOGS
Session: A sequence of network HTTP basic auth requests and responses associated with the same user.. Session ID will be created when a 
user first access a system. 2nd thing is the EXCHANGE of session cookies between a SERVER and a USER'S DEVICE.
Session cookies ensure that no sensitive info like credentials etc are shared, prevent attackers from obtaining sensitive info
FLAW: An attacker can impersonate a user through SESSION HIJACK- Monitoring and accounting of ACCESS LOGS can detect this on-time.
Exploit: Means taking advantage of a vulnerability.

Vulnerability Management:
1. Identify vulnerabilities- The most important step
2. Consider potential exploits
3. Prepare defenses against threats
4. Evaluate those defenses.
This is always a continuous process or cylce. New vulnerabilities are alsways being disovered, known as ZERO DAY EXPLOITS-
ZERO-DAY: An exploit that was previously unknown. The exploit is happening in REAL-TIME with ZERO DAYS to fix it.
Defense In Depth: Layered security approach. Referred to CASTLE APPROACH. Historically having a MOAT( Water filled defense)
GIANT STONE WALLS, WATCH TOWERS. Adopted in cybersecurity using a 5 Layer Design-
1. Perimeter Layer- First step layer of DID e.g username and passwords. authentication layer
2. Network Layer- closely related with ATHORIZATION- include techologies like NETWORK FIREWALLS and
3. Endpoint Layer- devices that have access on a network e.g laptop, deskstop, or a server. Antivirus software is a technology
that protects this layer.
4. Application Layer- Interfaces that are used to interact with technology. Security measures are PROGRAMMED as part of an application
e.g MFA
5. Data Layer- Critical data layer e.g PII. Asset classification is a SECURITY CONTROLthat is very important in this layer.
A lot of orgs design their SECURITY CONTROL through this model-DID
Explosure: It is a mistake that can be EXPLOITED by a threat.
One of the most popular libraries of exposure is a CVE LIST-
Many orgs use these lists to find ways to IMPROVE THEIR DEFENSES.
Critical Used to Get a CVE Listed:
1. Independent of other issues.
2. Recognized as potential security risk
3. Submitted with supporting evidence
4. Only affect one code base.
NIST National Vulnerability Database will need to validate a CVE before it can PASS as one too-
> 9 is critical CVE
Vulnerability Assessment Process:
1. Identification- using scanning tools
2. Vulnerability analysis- using it to find the source of the problem
3. Risk assessment- A score is assigned to each vulnerability. impact of the vulnerability.
4. Remediation- address vulnerabilities that can impact the org. e.g enforcing security procedures, patches etc.
Attack Surface: All the potential vulnerabilities or threats that an actor can exploit
Attack Vectors: Pathway that attackers use to penetrate security defenses.e.g posting company's use that should not have been shared.
Practicing an attacker mindset:
1. Identify a target
2. Determine how a target can be accessed
3. Evaluate attack vectors that can be exploited
4. Find the tools and methods of attack.
Defending attack vectors:
Educating users
Applying least privilege rule
Using and applying security controls e.g installing antivirus 
Building diverse security team.

Threats:
Social engineering
Malware
Web-based exploit- online threats.
