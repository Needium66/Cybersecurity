The body of work that is showcased in this repo contain some projects that are undertaking in my role as a Security Operations Engineer or Cybersecurity Analyst or Systems Engineer or DevOps Engineer. It also extends to some personal development projects, in which some simulations are carried out to display understanding and retainership of the knowledge that is gained.

For every single project, there is a problem statement and a solution that presents the processes and implementation of methods that are executed to achieve the solution.

There is a link to the specific directory or file that provides detailed information on each project that is in this repo.
This repo contains a couple of years of projects in the making. It shines light on projects that involve threat, vulnerability, risk, data security in transit or at rest, IDR, SIEM, detection, analysis, and others.

There is a wide range of technology that has been utilized over time for the implementation of all these projects. Some of the technologies include Splunk. Tenable, Cybereason, Microsoft Defender, Microsoft Entra, IAM, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, AWS Configs, SSL/ TLS, Metasploit, Impacket, Pfsense, Security Onion, Python, Security Onion, Security Onion, Cisco, Harvester, Wireshark, SQL, Microsoft O365.

In no order, the below encapsulates each project as they appear in the repo:

#Splunk Project

#Problem Statement: There is no observatory or visibility on sign-in logs and audit logs in SIEM tool. It is imperative to be able to investigate or analyze any event related to user sign-ins and audit the logs in general in our Active Directory environment.

#Solution: Integrate the necessary components or technologies that will enable the forwarding of logs from AD to Splunk.

#Overview: 
Implemented this project to enable the ingestion of sign-in and audit logs from AD environment into Splunk, to complement the existing logs being forwarded for SIEM and improve the visibility into a previously non-integrated environment.
