#While troubleshooting how to get splunk enterprise backup, it was discovered that the certificate had expired
#How I got the certficate renewed
#KVstore failed
Why? If you don't have valid self-signed/third-party certificates enabled Splunk will fall on default certificates, which are expired in your case
Solution: rename your certficate file e.g serverfile.pem to serverfile.pem.back through a path e.g /opt/splunk/etc/auth and restart the instance
That should FORCE Splunk to create a NEW DEFAULT VALID CERTIFICATE. Try this process on all of your Splunk instances where there are default
certficates being used. Then run the below command on the instance where the kvstore errors were:
openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in ./server.pem
Note: It is important to run the command in the following path: /opt/splunk/etc/auth. First, go to /opt/splunk/etc/auth and then run the command

If you have made changes to inputs.conf regarding using certificates to secure connections, you can revert those changes since we are going
to try it first using default certificates, if after resolving thhe kvstore issues, you still want to secure your connections using your
own certificates you can still do that.
Once confirmed that your certifcate is not expired anymore, you can migrate the StorageEngine, which in your instance is currently 'mmapv'
but it has to be "WiredTiger" if your Splunk version is 9.0.0, First create a backup kvstore Backup KVStore-https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.1.0/Admin/BackupKVstore
You will be needing free storage space that is equal to twice the size of your KVstore directory in order to complete the migration.
Steps:
Stop Splunk Enterprise. Do not the -f option.
Open server.conf in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/directory.
Edit the storageEngineMigration setting to match the following example.

[kvstore]
storageEngineMigration=true
Save the server.conf file
To begin the migration, use the below command:
splunk migrate kvstore-storage-engine --target-engine wiredTiger

To reduce the strorage space required to migrate, use the --enable-comprehension option to compress the backup data. This option causes slightly
higher CPU usage.
Check the $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/mongod.log file on *nix or the %SPLUNK_HOME\var\log\splunk\mongod.log file on Windows to see the status
of your migration.
After verifying the migration is successful, start Splunk Enterprise again.
Delete the KV store backup data in the $SPLUNK_DB/kvstore/old_db directory on *nix or the %SPLUNK_DB%\kvstore\old_db directory on Windows.

Focus on the one referring to single-instance deployment.

If you have successfully migrated to WiredTiger, but not to the latest version of MongoDB, manually upgrade to the latest version of
MongoDB with the following CLI command.
splunk migrate migrate-kvstore
After completing all the steps above, you should not see any errors. You can confirm it by running "splunk show kvstore-status --versbose"
without quotes
Verify that serverVersion and storageEngine fields indicate the latest versions:
#STEPS
Sudo access to your splunks server through the DNS name or IP address
Let the stakeholder know that there will be brief interruption of splunk( cos you will have to restart it)
SSH to servers
Run command to take a backup and delete serverfile:
a. mv /opt/splunk/etc/auth/$serverfile.pem /opt/splunk/etc/auth/serverfile.pem.bak
b. you can remove the serverfile if needed- sudo rm /opt/splunk/etc/auth/serverfile.pem
Run the command to restart splunk with with executable program:
a. cd /opt/splunk/bin
b. ./splunk restart
Verify cert is renewed:
a. cd /opt/splunk/etc/auth/
b. openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in ./serverfile.pem
Update reminder file
