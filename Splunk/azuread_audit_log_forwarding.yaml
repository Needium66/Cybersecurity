#we have a self hosted splunk instance
#we require sign-in logs and audit logs to be forwarded to splunk as part of ms logs
#we will be sending those logs from one of our AzureAd
#Azure requires you to have at least a P2 license to be able to get logs sent from Azure to Splunk
#you have to have admin access to be able to carry out what are needed.
#all in all, we require logs for successful and failed logins, changes to user accounts and other activities to 
#protect our data, users and services against risks, security breaches and suspicious activities that can take place and
#needs to be investigated

#Steps
Create an app in AzureAd for the audit log forwarding
Give all required permissions to the app created to enable it to send logs to splunk
Install or update the Add-on required that will ensure the connection between Azure AD and Splunk
Create a tenant in the Add-on that will ensure the connection between AzureAD and Splunk
Create the inputs in office 365 Add-on, that will enable the ingestion of necessary logs into Splunk
Test for your logs by running some queries in search and reporting.

#Create an app in AzureAD for the audit log forwarding
Go to AzureAD and ensure that you are in the right AzureAD (We have 3)
Select "Azure Active Directory" or serach for it from the search bar at the top

Check the box in the page that pops up for agreeing to uodate
Click on "Accept and continue" button at the bottom(Splunk will restart once you do this)

#Create a tenant
Go back to the self-hosted splunk instance
Select "Apps" at the top left-hand side of the main page.
Go to "Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Office 365" and select it
Create a tenant for the office 0365 app that you created in AzureAD e.g you should see whatever tenant you created in AzureAD and select it
Enter a "Name" for it
Select "Worldwide" as endpoint
Enter the value of the TenantID for your app
Enter the client ID for your app
Enter the "Client secret" of your app
Leave the rest as default
Click on "Create" button

#Create the inputs to ingest the logs

#Test for your logs
Go to search and reporting on the main page and run the below queries
index = "main" (or whatever you use as index)
index ="_internal" 0365 sourcetype="splunk:ta:0365:log"
Run this query to know the status of your kvstore
| rest splunk_server=local count=1 /services/server/info
| table kvStoreStatus


#Queries
index = "_internal" o365 sourcetype="splunk:ta:0365:log"
index = "main"
"|rest splunk_server=local count=1 /server"

Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Office 365
Install and configure it in Splunk
Set up an app with necessary permissions in AzureAD (This will be forwarding the logs to Splunk)

Event Hub was set up for AzureAD tenant and Azure audit. Logs should be streaming from the AzureAd tenant into Splunk.

To be able to launch app to connect Azure App account to Splunk for Microsoft Azure Add-on for splunk, you will have to restart splunk-a brief pause.


To get an accurate count of daily log usage, these logs need to be forwarded to Splunk
Windows event logs from all windows servers
Linux syslogs, including AWS AMI EC2 instances
AWS IAM logs
AWS ACL logs
Azure AD logs
CISCO ASA logs
AS400 logs
DC logs- successful logins, failed logins, changes to user accounts, changes to security groups
Need accurate counts for Splunk renewal licensing

#To log elastic beanstalk
Install cloudwatch agent on each instance
Set up a config from that
Give IAM role with permissions to launch CloudWatch
Set up functions
Make necessary code changes

Recreate functions where log groups exist (account and regions where log groups are configured)
