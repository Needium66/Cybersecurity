AzureAD Audit Log Forwarding to Splunk: In order to be able to carry out SIEM or investigations on security incidences that could occur
in AzureAD where users, resources, applications and others are housed in an organization, it is pertinent to be able to get sign in and

highlighted in this project.
Requirements
A  running Splunk instance.
An Active Azure AD.
Office 0365 Add-On On Splunk

cluster like most. So there is no fault-tolerant or DR for this particular instance. The index and run in the same instance.
My problem statement is to integrate this splunk instance with our active directory so that we can be able to view and carry out
further post mortem on sign-in logs and audit logs in it. Some of the resources I used to carry this out can be found at the top.
