#first 1, 0- the first parameter is auxilliary, the second one is scanner, the third one is portscan, then ftpbounce
#the one you can focus on or look for is 5 auxilliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
#run use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/syn
#to know what the module is all about, run "info". it will tell its name, who created it and what it does:
#enumerate open tcp services using tcp
#run "options" next
#run "set ports 1-65535"
#run "set rhosts 192.168.3.4" use this to scan only one address
# run this command "run" for it to start scanning or run "sploit"
#all it does is to tell you whether an ip is open or close
