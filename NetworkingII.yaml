Networking II- Routers and switches
All about my coursework.
LAN Standard Review
1) Point-to-Point- Just 2 points or nodes
2) Multi-point- 3 or more nodes or points
MESH: each node to every other node
ADVANTAGE- redundant pathways; not practical
DISADVANTAGE- expensive; redundant wire, each needs a NIC( Network Interface Card)
STAR: each device connects to a CENTRAL POINT
ADVANTAGES - each node is isolated on its own cable
Easy to connect and disconnect without disrupting other nodes
All data goes through a central point.
Easy to isolate problems
DISADVANTAGES: Requires more cable
HUB failure will disable entire network.
There are 3 types of HUB
1) PASSIVE HUB- It is a simple signal splitter. Main function is to electrically CONNECT the arms of the HUB. All traffic is routed to all nodes.
2) ACTIVE HUB- Does same as PASSIVE HUB, but it REGENERATES and RETRANSMITS the message
3) INTELLIGENT HUB- Similar to ACTIVE and PASSIVE HUBS. But it does more intelligently- it makes more INFORMED PATH SELECTION; it is only
sent to the NODE that needs the MESSAGE.
RING: each node in the ring RECEIVES a message and RETRANSMIT it to the next. This means each node acts as a REPEATER.
ADVANTAGE- NO signal degradation
DISADVANTAGE- A break in the ring may disrupt the network
Each node must be involved in almost each message transmission.
e.g a TOKEN RING
BUS: each node is ATTACHED to the same TRANSMISSION MEDIUM. Each node is IDENTIFIED with a UNIQUE ADDRESS.
ADVANTAGE- minimum cable cost
DISADVANTAGE- no central point, which means it is more difficult to troubleshoot.

HYBRID: combines parts of differnt topologies.
LOGICAL (VIRTUAL) TOPOLOGIES
1) LOGICAL RING- Data is passed from node to node, one at a time. Each node has a SEPARATE receiver path and transmitter path e.g TX and RX

LAN STANDARDS: Standards that are used in COMPUTERS to ease NETWORK connections between one computer and the other without regards to brands.
802.2 - Defines Logical Link Control (LLC)- This is close to what is called the Data Link Layer (Layer 2 in OSI Layer Model). Consist of LLC layer and MAC (Medium Access Control) layer
There are 2 types of LLC- Connectionless services e.g UDP is connectionless protocol UDP/IP e.g postal service. Connection-oriented services e.g TCP/IP e.g telephone
802.3 - Defines Ethernet (CSMA/CD)- Alternatively called CSMA/CD . It is said to be operating in Multiple Access (MA) mode. All data that is
transmitted by the SENDING COMPUTER is encapsulated or formed into a FRAME addressed to the DESTINATION COMPUTER. The FRAME is broadcast
over the common cable. All computer's connected to this cable DETECT that a FRAME is being transmitted. Only computer that MATCHES the destination
address continues receiving the FRAME and responds according to PREDEFINED LINK PROTOCOL. 
802.4 - Defines Token Bus
802.5 - Defines Token Ring

Difference between Broadband and Base or Baseband- Baseband; the wire can only handle one message at a time(channel at a time) while Broadband; the wire can handle multiple messages at a time.
The Network Interface Card(NIC) CONNECTS the COMPUTER(DTE) to the Ethernet Line using 5 wires

100% of LAN is Ethernet today i.e CSMA/CD. It is more popualr than Token Ring now. Token Ring was more popular in the 1970's about 80% of LAN
and Ethernet was 20%.

ROUTERS AND SWITCHES shaped MODERN NETWORKING
Router has 3 interfaces
Serial 1 interface - S1
Serial 0 interface - S0
Ethernet Interface- E0
The serial interfaces (S1 and S2) are used to CONNECT OTHER routers.
Ethernet interface is used to CONNECT computers to FORM the LAN.
E.G Having 3 routers connecting routers together to form WAN- the phase between routers. So between these 3 routers wil be 2 WANs WAN 1 
and WAN 2. 3 routers- Router A, B and C. Ethernet will form 3 LANs then LAN 1, 2 and 3
Comparing Ethernet with Token Ring: Traffic against Throughput.
Ethernet PERFORMS better in LOW TRAFFIC. As traffic increases, the number of collisions increase, and so the THROUGHPUT from ETHERNET
decreases in HIGH TRAFFIC. But Token ring PERFORMS better at High traffic.
SEGMENTATION and COLLISION DOMAINS indicate why ETHERNET is the most DOMINANT LAN today.
SEGMENTATION means we can add ROUTERS to ease or streamline the COLLISIONS occurring. Add 3 more routers. It was 100 routers before.
Divide into 3 segments- 34 routers on Router A, 34 on Router B, 33 on Router C.
SWITCH IMPORTANCE TO ETHERNET DOMINANCE:
Switch operates at OSI layer 2 i,e it uses the MAC address. Router uses the IP address. Switch has multiple ports. Using HUB in switches
enables it to have more COLLISION DOMAIN added and therefore makes ETHERNET performs better than TOKEN RING.
