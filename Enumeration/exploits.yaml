#Shell and payload types
#Exploitation
#What to do when there is nothing to exploit.

#Shell
#Reverse Shell:
#Using Netcat reverse shell-it is a port listener or port connector
#you have an attackbox snd set up a listener on port 4444
#there will be a target machine

#Bind Shell
#Victim will get connected to the attacker
#A malicious port will be opened up on the target machine and connect to it directly.
#It is easier to use as compared to reverse shell.

#Staged Vs Non-Staged Payloads

#Non-Staged
Sends all shellcode all at once
Larger in size and don't always work e.g windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

#Staged
Sends payload in stages
Can be less stable - because it sends things in stages e.g windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
