#FROM EXPERIENCE WHENEVER YOU ARE RUNNING OSCP, whenever you find port 80 opened, you will
#likely find credentials that will lead you to port 22 and allows you to get to a shell
#or gets an exploit on 80 that will get you to a remote code execution, get credentials
#ssh over and find root
#makes a finding on apache server header, eventhough it is saying the page is moved, it is still a finding
#chcek out the website on a browser by running the ip- 10.10.10.133
#you can view the page source

#we can run a nikto on the host for onetwoseven
#run
nikto -h onetwoseven.htb
#we can run a dirbuster too
#run the sftp for the hostname that you saw
sftp onetwoseven.htb
#add the username to it, it will prompt you for the password.
