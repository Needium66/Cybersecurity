#two types of web scanner that i will be using:
#nikto; that comes with kali
#you can run it from anywhere on your kali machine
#run "nikto"
#run "nikto H" to get all features
#to run nikto against a host, e.g tesla you can run "nikto -h https://tesla.com"
#It pulls out an IP, a series of IP, Cipher that is being used.
#I cannot put this out cause of security implications
#Got findings for anti-clickjacking, X-XXS protection header SSL and others
#checks all the headers
#do web scanning and try to offer suggestions that are exploitable e.g vulnerabilities
