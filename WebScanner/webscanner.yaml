#two types of web scanner that i will be using:
#nikto; that comes with kali
#you can run it from anywhere on your kali machine
#run "nikto"
#run "nikto H" to get all features
#to run nikto against a host, e.g tesla you can run "nikto -h https://tesla.com"
#It pulls out an IP, a series of IP, Cipher that is being used.
#I cannot put this out cause of security implications
#Got findings for anti-clickjacking, X-XXS protection header SSL and others
#checks all the headers
#do web scanning and try to offer suggestions that are exploitable e.g vulnerabilities


#Burp Suite- Most important tool you can own if you want to do web apps- It cost around $400 or more for pro edition
#To start your own test company, purchase nessus and burp suite- it may cost you around $3000- for annual licensing
#Set it up
#Pick a target e.g Tesla from the "Target" tab, the "intercept is on" once you click on "Target" by deafult
#Need to make your browser talk or connect to burp suite
#You could use a tool like Foxy proxy to enable to quickly change
#Open up a new browser
#Click on the menu icon that has "Preferences" on the far right of your browser page and select it.
#Scroll down to "Settings" at the bottom and click on it
#Select "Manual proxy configuration"
#Use your home address- ip and port
#Ensure the box "Use proxy for all protocols" is checked or enabled
#Click "Ok"
#You can go back to Burp Suite to see what it has intercepted from Tesla
#You can hit Forward to see what info it provides
#keeping hitting the "Forward" tab to see more.
#You can turn off the intercept, by clicking on the tab once more
#You can hit the "Target" tab again to see what is happening
#You can right click on the site you want to test e.g http...tesla.com and select "Add to scope"-"Sitemap" tab gets you here too
#Click on "Yes"
#Click on the "Filter" bar
#Select "Filter only in scope items" then your only in scope item becomes tesla.com
#You can click on the tesla bar on your left to expand to show more info it has gotten for you- called spidering
#the old burp suite allows you to right click and select "spidering". Not with the new burp.
#If you want to test more than tesla.com, you can to your scope by clicking on "Scope" and add a regex stuff
#something like wildcard. so instead of tesla alone, it gets info from other hosts.
#click on "Sitemap" tab 
#Right click on tesla host and select "Scan"
#Select your "Scan Type" e.g crawl and audit, crawl, audit selected item etc choose "audt selected item"
#select one item or more from the search box
#you can select "Scan configuration" to configure how you want it.
#go to "Resource pool", you can increase "Max concurrent request" from 10 to 100 if the website can handle that-runs 10 threads concurrently by default

#click OK
#Go back to your dashboard to view
#You can click "view details" to see what it has found.
#Click on "issue activity" to see what it has found
#in this case it found a ssl cert and robot.txt file
