#it is recommended to use gedit but unfortunately i was unable to get it installed on my machine.
#I deviced this method and follow the following steps to get it done on kali
#I created the week2 folder, by running "mkdir week2"
#I created a file with nano command and wrote the the code to print it " nano python101.py"
#I closed the file by running "ctrl + x", y, and "Enter"
#I ran "chmod +x python101.py" to make the file executable
#I ran "python3 pyhton101.py" to print what is on the file
#Unfortunately, i got missing parenthesis error on the file, because i was supposed to use
#parenthesis and not inverted brackets. So i corrected it by following the steps from nano
#it worked
